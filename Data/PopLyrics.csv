All I Really Want To Do,"Now I ain't lookin' to compete with you
Beat on, cheat on, mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you
Deny, defy, mystify you
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
Now I ain't lookin' to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
I ain't lookin' to block you up
Dock or rock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize or advertise you
All I really want to do, yeah
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
I don't want to straight-face you
Race or chase or track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do, yeah
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
Now I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you"
Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down),"I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
And I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this days sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down"
Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"If you need me, call me. No matter where
You are, no matter how far. Just call my
Name. I'll be there in a hurry. On that
You can depend and never worry.
(You see, my love is alive It's like a
Seed that only needs the thought of you to
Grow. So if you feel the need for company,
Please, my darling, let it be me. I may not
Be able to express the depth of the love
I feel for you, but a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved.
He said down and wrote these words:)
No wind, (No wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal
No wind, no rain,
Can stop me, babe
If you wanna go
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch you so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (Say it again)
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (One more time)
Ain't no river wild enough (Say it again)
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you"
"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves","I was born in the wagon of a travelling show
My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good
Gypsies, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was 16, he was 21
Rode with us to Memphis
And papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done
Gypsies, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
I never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later, I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh
I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh
She was born in the wagon of a travellin' show
Her mama had to dance for the money they'd throw
Grandpa'd do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good
Gypsies, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Gypsies, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Gypsys, tramps, and thieves"
Ben - Single Version,"Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)
I used to say ""I"" and ""me""
Now it's ""us"", now it's ""we""
I used to say ""I"" and ""me""
Now it's ""us"", now it's ""we""
Ben, most people would turn you away
(Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say
(A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben"
Rockin' Robin,"He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
Rockin' robin, rock rock

The Way Of Love,"When you meet a boy
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not
If a flame should start
As you hold him near
Better keep your heart
Out of danger, dear
For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go
Then what will ya do
When he sets you free
Just the way that you
Said goodbye to me
When you meet a boy
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not
If a flame should start
As you hold that boy near
Better keep your heart
Out of danger, dear
For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go
Then what will ya do
When he sets you free
Just the way that you
Said goodbye to me
That's the way of love
The way of love"
Touch Me In The Morning,"Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
Touch me in the morning..."
Half-Breed,"My father married a pure Cherokee
My mother's people were ashamed of me
The indians said that I was white by law
The White Man always called me ""Indian Squaw""
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, she's no good they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born
We never settled, went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
""Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee""
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, she's no good they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born
We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed
Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame
My life since then has been from man to man
But I can't run away from what I am
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, she's no good they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, she's no good they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born"
Dark Lady,"The fortune queen of New Orleans was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the backseat were scratches from the marks of men, her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass, she said, ""Home, James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room, she took my money, she said, ""I'll be with you soon""
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music 'til her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic 'til the clock struck on the 12
She told me more about me than I knew myself
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three and mumbled some words that were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack, my eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said, ""The man you love is secretly true to someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place, never come back and forget you ever saw my face""
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music 'til her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic 'til the clock struck on the 12
She told me more about me than I knew myself
So I ran home and crawled in my bed, I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume, and how I smelled, it was in my own room
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man, laughing and kissing 'til they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor, dark lady would never turn a card up anymore
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music 'til her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic 'til the clock struck on the twelve"

Love Hangover,"From rags to riches, here I stand
Shaped and molded by your loving hand
With faith and trust unshaken
You led me all the way
Through years of joy and tears
I'm standing here to say

Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To) - Single Version,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Now looking back at all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?"

MacArthur Park - Single Version,"Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left my cake out in the rain
And I don't think that I can take it

Heaven knows it's not the way it could be and
Don't you know there's no need to leave
Heaven knows I never wanna leave you
Heaven knows I only wanna please you
Don't you know love is what I need
Down inside (down inside)
Don't get caught with foolish pride (don't get caught with foolish pride)
Put all the other things aside (things aside)
There's only you and me (you and me, you and)
Believe in us (believe in us), we were always meant to be (always meant to be)
Me for you and you for me (you for me), 'till eternity ('till eternity)
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be and

The Boss,"Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Wanna be run
I had a one-step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss
I'd defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control whatever moved in my soul
I could tempt
Touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
I was so, so sure
But love taught me
Taught me who was, who was the boss
Love taught me
Taught me
Taught me
Taught me
I was so right
So right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
So sure
But love taught me
Taught me who was, who was the boss
Love taught me
Straight, straight up in my face
Love taught me who was the boss
Love taught me who was the boss
Love taught me
Love taught me
Love taught me who was the boss
Love taught me who was the boss"

Why Do Fools Fall In Love,"Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Love is a losing game
Love can be my shame
I know a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why
Tell me why
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does my heart
Skip a crazy beat?
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why
Tell me why
Why do fools fall in love?
Tell me why

Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger),"hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire
But I know since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's gettin' ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just want to let you know

Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
Mama used to tell me
Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'
Hit it with your best shot every time
Well I, I didn't understand her
'Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
Or love will blow you right away
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger

"Mirror, Mirror","Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You, you turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama
Chapter one
When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken
And now
My eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I
Remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
I talk to you each night
And I follow your advise
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go!
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
'Thought you said you had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
Let me go

Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover"

Human Nature,"Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature

She likes the way I stare

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench's in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
Are closing in to seal your doom (oh, yeah)
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

Crazy for You,"Swaying room as the music starts

I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss

Missing You,"Since you've been away

The reason you left me
What were you going through?

Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away boy
I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me!
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy
Here today!
There was so much you gave me
To my heart
To my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns"
Material Girl,"Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me

Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

How Will I Know,"There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?
Ooh, how will I know? (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me how will I know? (don't trust your feelings)

Greatest Love of All,"… I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
… Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me
… I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
… Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
… I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
… I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
… Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
… The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all
… And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

Live to Tell,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well

What Have You Done For Me Lately,"He stood me up again
Mmm-hmm
Yes, honey, I love him, he is fine
He does a lot of nice things for me
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy-keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Used to go to dinner almost every night
Danced until I thought I'd lose my breath, ah

Ain't that a shame?
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this Earth
I'm tellin' you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always puttin' off what we could do today
Soap opera says you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?

A Different Corner,"I'd say love was a magical flame
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"
I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),"Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all
Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You never let it end
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all"

I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
""I do""
""I do""
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, ""Hey farewell"" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do"
Causing a Commotion,"[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy
The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you
[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove
[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove
[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion"
Let's Wait Awhile,"There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile before we go too far
Remember that special night
When all of the stars where shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far
I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember, I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you
Let's wait awhile, awhile before it's too late
You know you can't rush love, love
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far
Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far
I promise, I'll be worth the wait"
La Isla Bonita,"Como puede ser verdad
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama"

Diamonds,"You tell me you love me
You tell me you care
But when I'm around you
It's like I'm not there
I need a reminder
Something you can see
Something on my finger
Shining so brightly
Don't you know
Diamonds are a
Girl's best friend
When you go, they stay
With me until the end
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's
Best, best friend
When you go, they stay
With me until the end
Don't want your money
Don't want your key
Diamonds
Love don't come for free
You sent me some roses
But roses do die
You gave me some candy
It melted, nice try
I'm not that demanding
I have simple taste
I just want a token
That can't go to waste
Diamonds
Don't you know
Diamonds are a
Girl's best friend
When you go, they stay
With me until the end
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's
Best, best friend

Faith - Remastered,"Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them, too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more
Yes, I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I just gotta have faith)
Oh, oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more
'Cause I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith"
One More Try - Remastered,"I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't just let me go
'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
And teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to learn
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold
Inside
Maybe just one more try"
Man in the Mirror - 2012 Remaster,"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
gonna feel real good now
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)
I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man
You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up
Stand up and lift
Yourself, now
(Man in the mirror)
Gonna make that change come on

Father Figure - Remastered,"That's all I wanted
Something special, something sacred
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, whoa
That's all you wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your life
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, oh oh
I will be your father figure
(Oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine
(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher
(Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind
(It would make me)
I will be your father figure
(Very happy)
I have had enough of crime
(Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be
Strong, baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes, baby
And love can't lie, no
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always tellin' me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind, baby
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
(So I am gonna love you)
'Til the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your preacher
I will be your daddy, whoa
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time"
Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me (ooh, baby)
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?

Dirty Diana,"Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back""
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors, for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
And then I ran to the phone
Sayin', ""Baby I'm alright""
I said, ""But unlock the door""
'Cause I forgot the key
She said, ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

One Moment in Time,"Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown
I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains
I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity
I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands
Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity
You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine
Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will be
I will be
I will be free
I will be
I will be free"
Kissing a Fool - Remastered,"You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find
Peace of mind
Til you listen to your heart
People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart
You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces
And mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find
Peace of mind
While I listen to my heart
People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them
Steal your heart
And people
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you
Like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other
You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too
I guess you were kissing a fool
You must have been kissing a fool"
I Found Someone,"Don't you know, so many things they come and go
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you
And I remember the thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone
Dry your eyes. I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings you never really knew
But, baby, don't ya lose that thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe
That maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone
Too long on the border line, wonderin' if your love was really mine
But you left me with open eyes, and when I realized, baby
I found someone to take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone
Baby I found someone to take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone"

Express Yourself,"Come on, girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I've got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast, you know they never last, no, no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart, but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Express himself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh, baby, ready or not
Express yourself"

This Time I Know It's for Real,"What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I
Stand in line
One of a million
Admiring eyes
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby
When I get my hands on you I won't let go
This time I know it's for real
Should I write or call your home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, tv news
Got to find a way
To get the message to you
To say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine
I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for real
Ooo baby
This time, this time, this time, this time
Oh baby
This time, this time, oh baby
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, oh baby

Smooth Criminal - 2012 Remaster,"As he came into the window was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment, he left the bloodstains on the carpet

Vision of Love,"Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind (yeah)
Sweet destiny (and you know that you did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me (prayed through the night)
Prayed through the nights (so faithfully)
So faithfully (faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually (he would find me)
I had a vision of love

I had a vision of love

Said you needed time away

To see your smile again

Not able to let go
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one

Praying for Time - Remastered,"Oh-oh, yeah
Mmm
To-do-do, oh-oh
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned His back and all God's children
Crept out the back door
And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, too much, too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time
To-do-do, oh-oh
Mmm, whoa-whoa, yeah
These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back 'cause he has no children
To come back for?
It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
To-do-do
Oh-oh, yeah"

Don't give a damn
Always carrying on
With the gang
I'm tryin' to tell ya, boy

Not afraid to die
Heart beat, real strong
But not for long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die
You're so together, boy
But just at a glance
You'll do anything
If given the chance
Scheming, planning lies
To get what you need
So full of promises
That you never keep
Don't you tell yourself
That it's okay
Sick and tired of
All of your games
And you want me to stay
Aw, better change
Makes no sense to me
Your crazy ways
Don't understand
Why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Not afraid to die, guitar

Here We Are,"Here we are
Face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know
The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me
Is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you, no no no
Here we are
All alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, a breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this
I want to stop the time from passing by
I want to close my eyes and feel
Your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms
Oh baby what you do
I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time
No no no
Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world
Sometimes lies
Become the game, when loves the prize
And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you
Is something I should hide
When I have you close to me
The feelings so sublime
That there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you, no no no
Can't keep from loving you baby
No no no
That there's nothing I can do my baby
To keep from loving you"
Love Takes Time,"I had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone (Ooh-ooh)
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly (Oh-oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here, alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside (Oh, oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there, alone"
Just Like Jesse James,"You're struttin' into town like you're slingin' a gun
Just a small town dude with a big city attitude
Honey are you lookin' for some trouble tonight
Well alright
You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight
Oh, that's right
You think you'll knock me off my feet
'Til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is cryin' Indian and I'm begin' for more
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for
If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well you ain't so strong, won't be long 'til your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in
Dead or Alive
That's right
You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back
'Cause I'm ready baby
Aim and fire
Baby there's nowhere you gonna run tonight
Ooh That's right
Well you've had your way with love but it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say
If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
You think you'll knock me off my feet
'til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is cryin' Indian and I'm begin' for more

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on

I'm gonna shoot ya down Jesse James"
This One's for the Children,"There are some people living in this world:
They have no food to eat, they have no place to go.
But we all are God's children, we have to learn to love one another.
Just remember they could be us.
Remember we all are brothers.
I'm not trying to darken up your day.
But help others in need and show them there's a better way.
This one's for the children, the children of the world.
This one's for the children.
May God keep them in His throne.
Many people are happy and many people are sad.
Some people have many things that others can only wish they had.
So, for the sake of the children, show them love's the only way to go
'Cause they're our tomorrow, and people they've got to know.
I'm not trying to darken up your day.
But help others in need and show them there's a better way.
This one's for the children, the children of the world.
This one's for the children.
May God keep them in His throne.
This one's for the children, the children of the world.
This one's for the children.
May God keep them in His throne.
The children of the world.
This one's for the children.
This one's for the children.
This one's for the children.
This one's for the children."
Someday,"You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only
But when your down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Love Will Never Do (Without You),"… Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They've all said we'd never last
Still, we manage to stay together
… There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

We had to prove them wrong

Justify My Love,"I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love (my love)
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to be your baby

What are you gonna do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love

Emotions,"You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

I Don't Wanna Cry,"Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When we only bring each other pain
I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul (Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
Is just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul (Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing
'Cause I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul (Given you my heart and soul)
I've given you my heart and soul (Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry
I don't want to cry
I don't want to cry"
Coming Out of the Dark,"Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Though life is never easy
The rest in unknown

Hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe
Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me
Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger
Holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through
I know I can
I may not make it easier
But I have felt you
Near all the way
Coming out of the dark

And it's shining on me

Stand on the rock
Of your love is all it takes
No matter what we face

Love Takes Time,"I had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone (Ooh-ooh)
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly (Oh-oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here, alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside (Oh, oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there, alone"

I was just a young boy
Didn't know what

I was every little hungry
Schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race?
A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and
A big fat place
On your rock and roll TV

I play the game is not the same
No way
Think I'm gonna get myself happy

Deep inside of me
There's someone
Else I've got to be

Picture in a frame
Take back your
Singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes

Belong to me yeah, yeah

We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a
Brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way
I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy
I think there's something
You should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

You've gotta give for what you take
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell

Side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

Remember the Time,"I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see
Do you remember
When we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
Do you remember
How we used to talk?
You know
We'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said?
Like, I love you so, I'll never let you go
Do you remember
Back in the Spring?
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time ('cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time (oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(Remember, my baby)
Remember the time
Woo
Remember the time
Do you remember, girl?
Remember the time
On the phone, you and me
Remember the time?
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in Spain
What about, what about
Remember the time
Remember the time
Ooh, in the park
Remember the time
After dark
Do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you

Giving Him Something He Can Feel,"Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from, yeah
But you will see it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine
Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seems so uptight
But nothing's wrong
And it's alright with (nothing's wrong, it's alright), my man (my man)
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on with my man
People out there can understand
I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
Ooh, to let him know this love is real (hey)
Givin' him somethin' he can feel (oh my love)
To let him know this love is real (oh my love is real)
This love is real
So much joy for us, it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true
You tell me what does it mean?
Livin' in a world of ghetto life

Humpin' Around,"When you trust someone

Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's all about

Make It Happen,"Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)
You're gonna make it happen, oh yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers if you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight

What About Your Friends,"Friends
What about your friends?
What about?
Friends
What about your friends?
What about, what about?
Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
Or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before
Then you're still down with me
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Well is it me or can it be
I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity
To what others must take as
A form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own?
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose
And then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there
With you through the thick and thin
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
Woah
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Yo, this is me, well is it me

I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me, yeah, yeah
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up

Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just
Another
Lonely
Love Song."
"Will You Be There (Theme from ""Free Willy"")","Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show it to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
Hold me (show me)
Lay your head lowly (told me)
Softly then boldly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Lead me (hold me)
Love me and feed me (lead again)
Kiss me and free me (yeah)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human)
Carry (carry)
Carry me boldly (carry, yeah)
Lift me up slowly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Save me (lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me
I will be there (I will be there)
Lift me (told me, yeah)
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly (yeah)
Show me you care (will you be there?)
Hold me (woo)
Lay your head lowly (get lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly (I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there (will you be there?)
Need me (woo)
Love me and feed me (lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me (lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed (oh-yeah)"

All That She Wants,"She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
""Oh, what a morning""
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes

What About Your Friends,"Friends
What about your friends?
What about?
Friends
What about your friends?
What about, what about?
Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust
Or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before
Then you're still down with me
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Well is it me or can it be
I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity
To what others must take as
A form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own?
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose
And then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there
With you through the thick and thin
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
Woah
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Yo, this is me, well is it me
Or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity
To what others must take
As a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
Woah
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?
I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me, yeah, yeah
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down? hey yay
Woah
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?

Rain,"I feel it...
It's coming...
Rain
Feel it on my finger tips

Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
Rain
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not

Your love's coming down like
Rain
When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears?
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky?
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
'Til I feel your

Feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like...
Here comes the sun! Here comes the sun
And I say, never go away
Waiting is the hardest thing
(It's strange)
I tell myself that if I believe in you
(I feel like I've known you before)
In dream of you
(And I want to understand you)
With all my heart and all my soul
(More and more and more)
That by sheer force of will
(When I'm with you)
I will raise you from the ground
(I feel like a magical child)
And without a sound, you'll appear
(Everything strange)
And surrender to me, to love
(Everything wild)
Rain is what the thunder brings

How you know?
Wait a minute guys.
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's
serious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So, let's deal with
the problem.
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk.
And it goes a little something like this - hit it.
Mmm.....
Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
Give it up turn it loose
Turnin' it loose, baby"
The Sign,"Shock!
I, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me
Is enough enough?
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?
Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Is enough enough?
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now
Living without you
I've left you, oh oh oh
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

I Swear,"I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
But you can be sure I know my part
'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I'll make mistakes
I'll never break your heart
I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
'Til death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear
I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the wall
And when there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as time turns the page
My love won't age at all

Hero,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you"
Breathe Again,"If I never feel you in my arms again

That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again

About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the love that you make to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away
And I can't stop carin' about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you
That, that I shall never breathe again
Breathe again
That I shall never breathe again
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinkin' about
How could your love be leavin' me
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rythm of my heart
No, I can't stop doin' without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause I know I can't deny
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again
If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you

I'll Remember (Theme from the Motion Picture With Honors),"Hmm, hmm
Say goodbye
Not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say goodbye
Not knowing how to cry
You taught me that
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember
Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember
I learned
To let go
Of the illusion
That we can possess
I learned to let go
I travel in stillness
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember, hmm
I'll remember, hmm
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own

Whatta Man (feat. En Vogue) - EP Version,"Yeah, yeah (ooo)
Uh, hey hey
All right, yeah
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I want to take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found someone that can make me laugh
You so crazy, I think I want to have your baby
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Say it again y'all
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a nucca out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I got a good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty good man"
Without You,"I won't
See your smile

I'll hold on to the memories baby
Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you
God knows I need you to know, oh baby
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I wanna trust you
And oh, baby, how I love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

Waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She give him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast"

It's Friday night and I feel all right
The party is here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honey's in the street say, Monty, yo we made it
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and my guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an OG mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower case G
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from
Then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
And all they said was 6'8 he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a DJ and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're making the dash
Oh, I'm buzzing because

I Can Love You Like That,"They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
That one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
You will never forget
The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet
All this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I never make a promise I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever, forever's what I mean
I'm no Casanova but I swear this much is true
I'll be holdin' nothing back when it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
You want tenderness-I got tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man who understands
You don't have to look very far"
You Are Not Alone,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go?
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone (You are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
I am here to stay (You and me)
For you are not alone (You're always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
Not alone, oh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me
Not alone
Oh, together, together
Gotta stop being alone
Gotta stop being alone"

I need someone who understands
I'm a woman, a real woman
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

I want you back for good
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good

"Exhale (Shoop Shoop) - from ""Waiting to Exhale"" - Original Soundtrack","Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop
Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, to wish you well
You'll find your point when

Not Gon' Cry,"While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago
Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times
Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health
'Til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our heart
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times
Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you were never worth my tears
Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you were never worth my tears
Well I'm not gon' cry

Before You Walk Out of My Life,"Here we are, face to face
With the mem'ries that can't be erased.
Although we need each other, things have changed.
It's not the same.
Sometimes it makes me wonder.
Where would I be if you hadn't discovered,
Reaching deep inside of me?
I know there was something
That we could compare.
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
And I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
Remembering the good times
From a portrait hung on high.
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind.
I made the choice when you couldn't decide.
I made the choice; I was wrong you were right.
Deep down inside I apologize.
Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
So I'll make plans with you
To always have time for you,
Before you walk out of my life.
I guess it's true,
Can not live without you.
Don't ever go away,
Oh, yeah,
Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
Never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life."

Just A Girl,"Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome

Back for Good - Radio Mix,"I guess now it's time for me to give up, I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams

Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

I'll Be Missing You (feat. 112) - Instrumental,"Yeah, this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in Heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death
Every step I take, every move I make (ohh, I'll miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
Somebody tell me why
One black morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every day that passes (every step I take)
Is a day that I get closer (every move I make)
To seeing you again (every single day)
We miss you B.I.G. (every night I pray)
And we won't stop (every step I take)
'Cause we can't stop (every move I make)
That's right (every single day)

The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems (that's right)
You used to say it'll be ok

Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you (uh-huh)
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?

I Want You,"Any time I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings taken shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try and explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face and the human cannonball
I need to, I want to come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But I'm looking and the smell perfume, it's like I'm down
On the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation is time and place of the interaction of a lover
And the nick of time over talkin using signals, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver who is swimming
With a raincoat, come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Any time I need to see your face

In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try and explain I just hold on tight
And if it happens again I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face
And the human cannonball, I need to I want to
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out, so can we find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But oh, I would die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you

And now you tell me that you're falling in love

Throwing far too much emotions at me

This I swear (I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you

Say you will be there, ow

Ah, won't you sing it with me?
If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation
Then I guess I'll have to show you the door
There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid
I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I'll give you everything)

All Cried Out (feat. 112) - Behind the scenes Video,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa oh.
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure,
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused...
Now I'm all cried out, over you
Oooo
I'm over you, oh yeah you
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh why was I such a fool, baby (Why was I such a fool)
Oh yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
(Tears will cause an inferno baby)
Romance often fades
Why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected
I, I gave you all of me
How was I to know
You were awaken so easily
I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out) over you
I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
You (you left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)

Please forgive me baby, oh

Strawberries I'm thinking
Or some honey for your toes

So aroused by you
So click on the cable

How could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you""
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine? Tell me
How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything?
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me
Somebody tell me please
If you love me
How could you do that to me?
Tell me
Hey
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?

Break my heart so bad? (Break my heart, oh)

No rolling with an entourage
Celeb' style like a movie star
Sippin down with the ladies all around me
Laughing girls off at the way I was of the morning
Gettin' beeps from Milan and Delhi

You got me giving up the things I used to do
You got so much in life to gain
And to prove to you I'm getting out the game
No more players style"
Don't Cry for Me Argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

The boy is mine
Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh huh sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
You know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no, no he's mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)
You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused, ohh)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, ohh
You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)

He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine
You can't destroy this love I found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start
You need to give it up (give it on up)

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems (that's right)
You used to say it'll be ok
Suggest little nice things I should do (uh-huh)
And when I go home at night and lay my head down

Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you (uh-huh)
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?

My Way,"Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all y'all other... (look)
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, ""Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?""
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying ""You, can't, front""
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby""
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control"
My All,"Te estoy pensando
En mi larga noche en soledad
Si el error fue amarte
En mi corazón vuelvo a estar mal
Porque estoy en ti
Y no se vivir
Si a mi lado no estas
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche mas
Y asi poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mi
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aqui nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy por tener...
Tu amor
Dime si me sientes
Imaginando verme frente a ti
Siempre estas presente
Y en mis sueños logro descubrir
Que aunque ya no estas, mi estrella fugaz
Te deseo alcanzar
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche mas
Y asi poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mi
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aqui nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy por tener...
Tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche mas
Y asi poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mi
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aqui nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy por tener...
Tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy...
Mi amor...
Mi amor"
The First Night,"Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? What?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? What?
Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, 'fraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of giving in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
We were chillin', watchin' your tv
I felt it was coming the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Trying to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting too late
I'm thinkin'
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (Knowing)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right)
I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby)
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (You're probably thinkin' something's wrong)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right)
I wanna get down, but not the first night
If you want me, you've got to know me (Got to know me)
And if you want my love (my love)
You've gotta wait, my love
Hey baby, that's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me (get to know me)
So we can do this
I should make a move (ohhhhhhh)
I know you're probably thinkin' (I won't, I won't, baby)
Knowing if I do (I won't, I won't, baby)
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (no, no, no)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong (oh no, no, no)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night (I wanna get down, but not the first night)"

This Kiss,"I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)
This kiss, this kiss
Cinderella said to Snow White
How does love get so off course, oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss (unsinkable)
This kiss, this kiss
You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, or
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let every thing slide
You got me floating, you got me flying
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)

Never Ever,"A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so?
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter, either way, I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way, I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions
I have to find
My head's spinning
Boy, I'm in a daze
I feel isolated
Don't wanna communicate
I'll take a shower, I will scour
I will rub
To find peace of mind
The happy mind I once owned, yeah
Flexing vocabulary runs right through me
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
I'm not crazy
I'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong, no
I'm just waiting
'Cause I heard that this feeling
Won't last that long
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole?

Don't wanna hurt no more
I need peace, gotta feel at ease
Need to be
Free from pain, going insane
My heart aches, yeah
Sometimes vocabulary runs through my head
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind

Looking Through Your Eyes - from the motion picture Quest For Camelot,"Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see
Through your eyes
I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see
Through your eyes
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes
I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes
And there are some things we don't know
Sometimes a heart just needs to go
And there is so much that I'll remember
Underneath the open sky with you forever
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes
Looking through your eyes"

Cruel Summer,"Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are sayin' (what did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
Leavin' me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone
The city is crowded, my friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle, so I got to get up and go
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
Leavin' me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone
Gonna feel only it was
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
(Leavin' me) leavin' me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer

Too Much,"Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep and meaningless, words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (eases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
There ain't no release for me
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder (ooh)
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied (ooh)
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me
Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder (ooh)
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied (ooh)
What part of no don't you understand (understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder (ooh)
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied (ooh)
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie"
Ray of Light,"Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of Heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel...
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
She's flying
Quicker than a ray of light
I'm flying"

All Cried Out (feat. 112) - Behind the scenes Video,"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa oh.
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure,
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused...
Now I'm all cried out, over you
Oooo
I'm over you, oh yeah you
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh why was I such a fool, baby (Why was I such a fool)
Oh yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
(Tears will cause an inferno baby)
Romance often fades
Why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected
I, I gave you all of me
How was I to know
You were awaken so easily
I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out) over you
I, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
You (you left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)
(I'm so sorry babe) Over you
Please forgive me baby, oh
Please forgive"
The One I Gave My Heart To,"Hey
Ohh, yeah
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me
So I can understand?
If you love me
How could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you""
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine? Tell me
How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything?
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me
Somebody tell me please
If you love me
How could you do that to me?
Tell me
Hey
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
how could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad? (Break my heart, oh)
How could the one who made me happy (you made me so happy)
Make me feel so sad? (You made me feel so sad)
Won't somebody tell me? (Won't they tell me)
So I can understand (so I can understand)
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that? (How do you hurt me? Oh)
The one I gave my world to
Throw my world away? (Throw my world away)
How could the one who said, ""I love you"" (you said you loved me)
Say the things you say? (Do you really love me)
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies? (You told me lies, baby)
How could the one I gave my heart to
How could the one I gave my heart to, ooh
How could the one I gave my heart to

This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, it's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more
Tell me it's real
This feeling that I feel
Tell me it's real
For your love I will do anything
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, it's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, it's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more
Tell me it's real
(I'll be there for you, baby)
This feeling that we feel
(If you be there for me, sweetheart)
Tell me that it's real
(I thought that we were meant to be)
Don't let love come just to pass us by
(For eternity, I thought you loved me baby)
Try, it's all we have to do
(And mama told me take it slow)
(Boy you just don't know, anything about love)
It's up to me and you
(If you and I were meant to be)
To make this special love last forever more
(Then you would know, you'll be sure by the end of the song)"

Oh Babe, is it true that your girl don't do the things I do?
Are you missin' this love I used to give to you?
Had you comin' in the front door, leavin' out the back at night
Oh Babe, Oh Babe
Oh Babe, do you stay up all night thinkin' how I did you right?

She's All I Ever Had,"Here I am
On broken wings
Quiet thoughts
Unspoken dreams
Here I am
Alone again
I need her now
To hold my hand
She's all, she's all I ever had
She's the air I breathe, yeah
She's all, she's all I ever had
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
When I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
So much time
So much pain (but)
There's one thing
That still remains (it's the)
The way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there
She's all, she's all I ever had
In a world so cold, so empty
She's all, she's all I ever had
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes

Miami,"Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like ""hi Will""
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
""Welcome to Miami""
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, ""Will we loved your last hit""
So I'm thinkin' I'mma scoot me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth ""Miami""
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
""Welcome to Miami""
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home
""Miami""
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
""Welcome to Miami""
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

From This Moment On - Pop On-Tour Version,"From this moment, life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on
I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, I can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on, oh
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment, I will love you
As long as I live, from this moment on"
My Love Is Your Love,"If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me
As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us"
Almost Doesn't Count,"Ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Almost made you love me
Almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, babe
Didn't I? Didn't I?
You almost had me thinking
You were turned around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count
Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe
You found it in me
But you can't get to Heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows
Almost doesn't count
I can't keep on loving you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on trying
If you're looking for more
Than all that I could give you
Than what you came here for
Gonna find me somebody
Not afraid to let go
Want a no-doubt-be-there kind of man
You came real close
But every time you built me up
You only let me down
But everybody knows (everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count (almost doesn't count)
Ohh
(Hey) Ooh, everybody knows
(Hey) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey-yeah)
(Hey) Can't keep on, baby
(Hey) Can't keep on trying
Everybody knows (everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count
I can't keep on loving (woo-woo) you
One foot outside the door
(I) I hear a funny hesitation (ooh)
Of a heart that's never (never) really sure
Can't keep on trying (no no)
If you're looking for more
Than all that I could give you
Than what you came here for
Maybe you'll be sorry
Maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back, babe
From the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me
You're gonna stick around
But everybody knows (everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count
So maybe I'll be here
Maybe I'll see you around
That's the way it goes
Almost doesn't count"

Back At One,"Inconfundible lo que por ti yo siento
Y que increíble como todo cambia en un momento
No sé cómo fui feliz cuando no estabas cerca tú
Si hoy tú llenas toda mi verdad
Y cuento cada instante donde estás, yeah
Un, comienza sueño así
Dos, contigo junto a mi
Tres, niña ya lo ves que yo soy tuyo ahora
Y después, repito el uno, dos, tres
Si, con todo mi amor por ti
Y si la cuenta llega hasta el final
Vuelvo entonces a empezar, yeah
Que distante la pena cuando se va
Emocionante cuando ya no queda soledad
Y que importante la fuerza de esta unión
Nada ya nos puede separar
Si es que somos como un solo corazón pues
Un, comienza sueño así
Dos, contigo junto a mi
Tres, niña ya lo ves que yo soy tuyo ahora
Y después, repito el uno, dos, tres
Si, con todo mi amor por ti
Y si la cuenta llega hasta el final
Vuelvo entonces a empezar
Dile adiós a la noche que está naciendo un nuevo sol
Así vamos tú y yo naciendo en el amor
La vida llega al fin cuando me llenas con tú luz
Y encuentro el camino allí donde estás tú
Un, comienza sueño así
Dos, contigo junto a mi
Tres, niña ya lo ves que yo soy tuyo ahora

Breathe,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart
'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now
'Cause I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?

Yeah, uh uh
Darkchild, yeah

Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?

Looking at me like I'm hurt

I think he's just the man for you
… What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
… Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then, why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out
… What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me

Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,"Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
(Tell me why) tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be
You're asking me
To feel the things you never show
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?

And felt the fire in your sweet embrace

Meet Virginia,"She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin', she won't confess

She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful. Meet Virginia
She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears hi-heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia
Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen
Her daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President
Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home, and rip on the President
Meet Virginia
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life
She only drinks coffee at midnight, when the moment is not
Right, her timing is quite unusual
You see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic
And the shape of her body unusual
Meet Virgina I can't wait to
Meet Virginia, yeah e yeah hey hey hey

Ooh (na-na-na)
Yeah, yeah
Ooh (na-na-na)
Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still, I miss you somehow?
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love

Crash and Burn,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please

It's hard to find relief
And people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door

Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart

Lift you up and fly away with you into the night

Cowboy Take Me Away,"I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of blue bonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me
I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon and not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one for miles and miles
Except for maybe you and your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray

Gotta Tell You,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walk in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
It was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now
Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I want to get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you
Belong
Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be
Right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
It was just something in your eyes
That made me realize
But now I hear voices deep inside
Tellin' me, tellin' me
Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't want to love you if you don't love me
Don't want to need you when you won't need me too
Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight"
Waiting for Tonight,"Ah, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dream
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh, oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart
All alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, (tonight) oh (tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, (tonight) oh (tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms

Fallin',"I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya

At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)

What?"
U Remind Me,"Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen
See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you"

Fill Me In,"I got something to say, got something to say
Alright
(Can you fill me in?) Come on
Can you fill me in?
(What you want? What you want me to do? Yeah)
Can you fill me in?
(Let's talk about it)
I was checking this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
(Please leave a message after the tone)
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?""
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"" (Fill me in)
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down boun-bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?"" (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, who's property?
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby
""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?"" (Can you fill me in?)
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone (ooh yeah)
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"

Why is she calling now after so long?
Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me?
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

You gotta do much better
If you're gon' dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gon' dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me

Move your body up and down
Make your booty touch the ground

Is my vibe too vibealacious for you, babe?
I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

Never Had A Dream Come True,"Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back, or wondering
How it could be now or might've been
All this I know
But still I can't find ways to let you go
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you
Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use looking back, oh wondering
How it should been, now oh might've been
All this I know
But, still I can't find ways to let you go
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you
You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will
Say you will
You know you will oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
There's no use looking back, oh wondering
Because love is a strange and funny thing
No matter how hard I try and try
I just can't say good bye
No no no no
I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you"
Stranger in My House,"I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checking your clothes
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house
So I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses, goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk they would have nothing to tell
So what could it be?
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong when I say
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be
Who you say you are, you gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a
(Stranger in my house)
Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me?
Have I changed so drasticly?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same
It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house
Took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
He wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house"
Irresistible,"You know I don't know what it is
But something about you is so irresistible
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire
I Know I meant to say no
But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me
(Yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)
Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no
(I meant to say no)
But he's irresistible (irresistible)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
(I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
Can't you see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
he's so irresistible
Baby you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful
He's so irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
(I can hardly breath)
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
He's irresistible
Up close and personal (irresistible to me)
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me"
There You'll Be - 2007 Remaster,"When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I look and see your face
You were right there for me
In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be a place for you for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me (You were right there for me)

The things that we go through
When you're in love with me and I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk, talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh, baby, it's a shame, we couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about
And the feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you
Girl, it's a shame

Turn Off The Light,"It's getting so lonely inside this bed

Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off you
Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this

Butterflies,"All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch you
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you

What the hell? I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?

Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game we played, I rigged it
Then what if I said it wasn't true, so do you
You and I know, without me, there's no you
So what about the bills that were past due, paid for you
All you said to me is, ""Baby, I owe you"" (uh-huh)

Underneath Your Clothes,"You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes, is where I find them
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey
'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, hey
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh baby it's so funny almost don't believe it
As every voice is hangin' from the silence
Lamps are hangin' from the ceilin'
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl honey
Underneath your clothes
Whoa
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl"
Underneath It All,"There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're
You're something else
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better better
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps callin
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
that this here woman that adore
Aside from your temper
Everything is secure
You're good for me, baby
of that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lovely

No More Drama,"So tired, tired of all this drama

No more pain (no more pain)

No drama (no more drama in my life)

Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around

Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more
No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (no more game, messin' with my mind)
No drama, no more in my life (no more drama in my life, no one's gonna make me hurt again)

When you let go of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (free from all the game)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)

It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose

Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see
It's all in me, yeah
All in me, yeah
Where is your logic? (turn of the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need? Yeah (turn of the light, turn off the light)
(And I say follow me, follow me, follow me)
(Down, down, down, down, 'til you see all my dreams) where can you turn?
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
Follow me, follow me, down, down, down
I do not need, I do not need nobody (turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me down, follow me down, down, down
I do not need, I do not need nobody (turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams, see all my dreams
Follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams, see all my dreams
Where is your logic? (turn off the light, turn off the light)

Sk8er Boi,"He was a boy
She was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk
She did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her
She'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy
She said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV
Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along
And stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy
She said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy
She said, ""See you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world
I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See you later, boy""
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See you later, boy""
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know"
Long Time Gone,"Daddy sits on the front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My brother found work in Indiana
Sister's a nurse at the old folks home
Mama's still cooking too much for supper
And me, I've been a long time gone
Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone, and it ain't coming back again
Delia plays that ol' church piano
Sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord, I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone
Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone, and it ain't comin' back again
Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah, I'm gonna be a star
Now, me and Delia singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin'
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think, the rest is
A long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone, and it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don't know when
Long time gone, and it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well, it's been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone
Yeah, yeah"
Like I Love You,"Just somethin' about you
Way I'm lookin at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fail me, baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?
Listen
I kinda noticed something wasn't right, from your colorful face
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face'll change
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you, like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you, like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Yeah, you know I can make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down, baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket, and then
Maybe, we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby (girl)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe, we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby, girl
Ma, what you wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show, in the mall, kids ask, ""How'd the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me, I say ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like (yeah)
You have me sleeping in the same bed, e'ry night
Go ride with me, you deserving the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumping N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your brain)
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious, and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?
Maybe, we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe we'll fly the night away
I just wanna love you, baby, girl, oh!
Ain't nobody love you, like I love you (can't love you, like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (makes me trust ya like I do) (hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (hey!)
You will know the difference when
Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums (hey!)
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do, what they do
And that's what it is
Now, everybody dance"

Miss You,"Oh
Hey, yeah-yeah-yeah
No-no-no-no, no, no, no
It's been too long, and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said, I been needin' you, wantin' you (said, I'm needin' you)
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes, I miss you
Off to college, yes, you went away
Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone, and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back to me (to me)
Can you feel me? (Hear me callin')
Hear me callin' (for you) for you

Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?

Now I'm sittin' here (I miss thee)
Thinking 'bout you and the days we used to share
It's drivin' me crazy, I don't know what to do
I'm just wonderin' if you still care
(Don't wanna let) I don't wanna let you know that it's killin' me
I know you got another life, you gotta concentrate, baby
Come back to me (to me)

I don't really feel like talkin' (no)
No one here to love me (no, no, no)

Beautiful,"Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
(And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(The sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today
Ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Don't you bring me down today
Yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down
Ooh, today"
I'm with You,"I'm standing on a bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you, yeah, yeah
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you"
Where Is The Love?,"What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on? (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on? (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all?
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema, yo'
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?
Sing with me y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (yeah)
Something's wrong with it (yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)"

And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right
Don't be so quick to, walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you, wanna play
Dance with me

'Til the break of day
Dance with me

You like the way I move

Pull you close and share my groove

So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't want to hit the floor

It's time to take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

Landslide,"I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain then I turned around
And I saw my reflection in a snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Uh-uh (uh-uh)
Uh-uh (uh-uh), uh-uh, uh
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
I'm getting older too, well
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
And I'm getting older too
Well, I'm getting older too
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and ya turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
The landslide will bring you down"
Miss Independent,"Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love
What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise, It's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true
Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love.
What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise, It's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true
When Miss Independence walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally see
What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise, It's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true"
Calling All Angels,"I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
And I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
When children have to play inside so they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies 'cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing Queens and losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
And I'm (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)

Underneath It All,"There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete

Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better better
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
And each time you're around
My body keeps callin
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's an underside to you
that this here woman that adore
Aside from your temper
Everything is secure
You're good for me, baby
of that, I'm sure
Over and over again
I want more
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

Fighter,"Hmm, after all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger
Well I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff, time is up, 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm-hmm
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, yeah, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you
'Cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
I never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, uh-uh, it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gon' stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (oh, ooh yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter (fighter)
Thought I would forget
Thought I, but I remembered (oh)
'Cause I remember (oh)
I remember
Thought I would forget (oh)
I remember (oh)
'Cause I remember (oh)
I remember
Makes me that much stronger (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter"
Clocks,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
You are
You are
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing
Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go

And I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself
Oh, It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends (it never ends)
Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose
Oh, I'd tell myself
What good do you do?
Convince myself
Oh, It's my life
Don't you forget
Oh, It's my life
It never ends (it never ends)
And I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself
Oh, It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (it never ends)
Oh, It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends (it never ends)
Oh, It's my life (oh, Its my life)
Don't you forget (don't you forget)

Pieces Of Me,"On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me
Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts
Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop 'til I'm there
Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have
Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yeah
On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe
Oh, it seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me"
Leave (Get Out),"Mm, yeah yeah
I've been waiting all day here for ya bae
So won't you come sit and talk to me
You tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to a pillow tight
And think about how you promised me forever
I never thought that anyone (mm) could make me feel this way (uh)
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone

You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)
Tell me why you looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy you must've gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone
So now after all is said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
To think that you could be the one
Well, it didn't work out that way
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)

You said that you would treat me right ('cause you)
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)
I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice you've got to leave
Because my heart is breaking
With every word I'm saying, I gave up everything I had (oh)
On something that just wouldn't last (oh)
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes (oh, oh)
Get out

Toxic,"Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With You,"The real me is, a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
Real me is, to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately, I've been jaded, life got so complicated
I start thinking about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels like
But with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
Oh-oh-oh
Now that I'm with you
You speak and it's like a song
And just like that, all my walls come down
It's like a private joke, just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I start thinking about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what love feels like
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
Oh-oh-oh
Come and take me
Love you, save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now (baby, as I do now)
Now that I'm with you (now that I'm with you)
I can let my hair down

Walked Outta Heaven,"I'm rolling down a, lonely highway asking god
To please forgive me for messing up the blessing he gave to me I see,
Everything clearer now the nights as black as, black as its ever been
With out my girl I'ma lose it and I pray that he just sheds his grace on me, I need
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven,
It feels like I've damn near thrown my life away
I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, to get back right with you
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven
It feels like I've damn near to throw my life away
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do
It feels like I just walked, right out of heaven
See my mama told me that's if it's meant to be she'll come back
And she'll forgive me and the best thing I can do it to just
Let her, let her go, I know, I don't want to do it
But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
And I know that in my heart it's a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven,
It feels like I've damn near thrown my life away
I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, to get back right with you
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven
It feels like I've damn near to throw my life away
Like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do
It feels like I just walked, right out of heaven
Hey girl waiting for you all the time,
Supposed to move on with my life, and girl I tried, and I tried
I feel like I can't walk, I feel like I can't talk girl I don't know
What to do get back right with you I feel like I just walked outta heaven baby
If you ever loved somebody, and if you ever had somebody
But you know that you hurt that somebody
Let me hear you say yea
It feels like I've just walked right out of heaven
It feels like I've damn near thrown my life away
I'm scared just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, to get back right with you

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway
I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Breakaway
Breakaway"
Everytime,"Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move uneasy
And every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away
And every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby"

We Belong Together,"When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Haha, remix, Desert Storm
Uh, yo, show your respect whenever you hear me or see me
(This is the emancipation of Mimi)
Hot like the real fever, the real diva
So successful, yet, still so eager
No matter what they say, it's on forever
(It's our time right now) more than ever
(To the death) we gon' get it on together
And MC, you know we belong together, come on
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night (oh-oh)
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right, make it right, make it right
We belong together like the sun in the summertime
Bounce in a lemon range (skip in a hummer lime)
(P and kiss, in and out) Mariah on the other line
Baby, I'ma come back (believe it'll come a time)
We belong together like peanut butter and jelly
Februaries and skellies, after parties and tellies
Feel you in my stomach like you a part of my belly
Baby, I'ma come back with every part of you ready
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, ""If you think you're lonely now, wait until tonight""
Boy, I'm feeling all out of my element, throwing things, crying
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (let's go)
You gon' need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past, just let it be bygone's
Matter of fact, I know a fly song that we could vibe on
Let's get it straight
If it's the six or the quarter to eight
(Then I'm throwing Babyface or Shy on)
Yeah and Kiss, Ghost and MC
Get close and toast to the diva and MC's
Uh, the trees will blow
Big cups of Pinot Grigio (take it easy, though)
We belong together, we know that
Now I think that it's 'bout time we show that
Even though every moment won't be a Kodak (naw)
Sometimes we argue, I spaz out, grab my bozak
Come back not 'cause I have to, I want to
And naw, I don't just wanna have you, I want you, uh
I lost a part of me
When you left, boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
This is, the Desert Storm remix, haha (we belong together)
(Oh, baby, baby, we belong together)
DJ Clue, Desert Storm (oh, come back, baby, please)
We belong together (MC)
Oh, come back, baby, please (woo)
Is it so hard to believe? We belong together
We back, baby (oh, baby, baby, we belong together)
We belong together"

Behind These Hazel Eyes,"Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry
On the outside, anymore
Anymore
Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Da-da-da, un, da-da

Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway
I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

It's called switch, let's get it going
Switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn it around now, switch
Turn it over and hit it
Vibe to vibe a second
It's a club, girl, why you arrive naked?
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record?
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Huh, something sexy 'bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothin'
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or somethin'
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell, ""Stop that""
Dance is a hop, then a clap, flip it 'round
Now bring it on back, break it down, now
Switch, turn it over and hit it

I got a question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody?""
But oh, wait, woah, y'all forgetting when I was
Amateur spittin', before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin, baby, come on

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh?
What, you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and

Speed of Sound,"How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
And some get made, and some get sent

To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Every time I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When a storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When we touch, when we love
The stars line up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When a storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin' you until the day I die
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When a storm blows your way
Wanna be inside
When a storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When a storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven"
Because of You,"I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself 'cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die (I watched you die)
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young (and you're so young)
You should have known better (I was too young for you)
Than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain (you never saw me)
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you"
Truth Is,"Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past
Talked for a while
Asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye
And he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
Now the truth is it hurts
But I know that the fault is mine
Because I let him go
Tried to get over it
But it's messing with my mind
(Because I know)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Killing me because now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is)
(Truth is)
Wish I never choose
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
Killing me cause now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
I just gotta be honest
I guess
I-I guess, I'm still in love, in love, in love"

Cool,"It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that
You and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
C-cool, uh uh
I know we're cool, uh uh
Yeah, I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah
I know we're cool, yeah
Me and you."
Don't Lie,"Yeah
Uh, huh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the pre-da-tor
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Yeah you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (stop, st-st-stop, st-st-stop lying)
She said I'm leaving
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
And I lie and I lie
And I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie (no don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try (you gotta try, gotta try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (what you gonna do baby)
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Because you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, badabada, badabada, badabada, badabada
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, badabada, badabada, badabada, badabada
Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it
And I lie and I lie and I lie (and then I lie) 'til there's no turning back
I don't know why, and I lie and I lie 'til I don't know who I am
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie (don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah you know, know, know, know you gotta try (you know, you know, you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you, what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no babe, no, no, no, no (stop, st-st-stop, st-st-stop lying)"

When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares
It's like bugs up in here, like thugs up in here
Throw ya fingers up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Haters might have a slight grudge when I'm there
See this froze on my wrist, like bugs in my ear
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear
Pop Cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear, the way I like strud up in here
Don't get the Nike's smudged, that I wear
Drinks be flingin', minks be swingin', the way the pinky-ringin'
Link be blingin', you think we slingin'?
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin' behind ya
Eighteen inches and up, no sittin' on minors
After the club hittin' a diner
Spittin' the lines, and end up in a hotel, gettin' vagina, get it right
Ladies, rub ya tits if ya gettin' right (hey)

You like the way the drop I got is kitted, cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits
Must be how I hop on yachts and visit, tropic spots, I did it
The top the watch is glitted
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds
I got the type of machine guns, that cops and SWATs be hitted
Someone'll drop, but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin' shoppin' spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Never get checked, me and my glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin' a grands nothin' for 'lous
You ain't got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin' the chicks?
Ladies, rub ya tits if ya gettin' right (hey)
Niggas, grab ya dicks if ya gettin' right (ho)

After I done everything that you ask me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Move so fast, baby, now I can't find you
Ooh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like ya can't come through

Ooh
Two things I don't like when I'm tryna get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
So put it on me deep in the right direction
Ooh
You understand the facts that I'm tryna give to you
You're movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
Learn the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to stepping

If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you askin' for some
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say ooh

You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed

Ordinary People,"Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Girl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday, oh
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know, baby you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh
This time we'll take it slow"
Mississippi Girl,"Yeah
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Riding my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl
Woo!
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Riding my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl
Woo!
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
Still like wearing my old ball cap
Riding my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around this world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi, girl
Mississippi girl!
Oh oh
Mississippi girl!
Mississippi girl!
Yeah, yeah, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Mississippi girl!
Na,

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (No)

Over My Head (Cable Car),"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's all on
And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind"

So Sick,"Mmmh, mmmh, Yeah (doo, doo, dooo, doo)

Can't come to the phone

It's been months
And for some reason I just
Can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
Enough is enough
No more walkin' round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here
Said, I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here
Said, I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?"

How to Save a Life,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it′s just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you′ve told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he′s just not the same
And you′ll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"
Unfaithful,"Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa, anymore
And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Everytime We Touch,"I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me

Forgive me, my weakness, but I don′t know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

And every time we kiss, I swear I can fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can′t you hear my heart beat slow? I can′t let you go
I want you in my life

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (that I cry)

You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man, it's true
Ain't no other man but you"
Because of You,"I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself 'cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die (I watched you die)
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young (and you're so young)
You should have known better (I was too young for you)
Than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain (you never saw me)
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you"

You're making me want to say yo

I want a fire
To feel the burn
My desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then just leave
I'm looking for attention

Don't Forget About Us - Radio Edit,"Don't forget about us
Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no (Don't forget about us)
Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
My baby boy (Y'all know what this is, haha)
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby, yeah
Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this lovin' used to be?
I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms

"Jesus, Take the Wheel","She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on.""
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh"
Say Goodbye,"Look

Some things I gotta get off chest, aight?
Yeah, woah, woah-woah-woah, woah

Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me

Found myself asking, why? Why?

Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up (yeah)
I don't mean no disrespect

When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me

To thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking 'bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
Got me twisted

I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter
Is replacing you is so easy

Before He Cheats,"Right now, he's probably slow dancin'
With a bleached-blond tramp and she's probably gettin' frisky
Right now, he's probably buyin' her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showin' her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably sayin' ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbin' on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
A-'cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
I slashed a hole in all four tires

Makes Me Wonder,"I wake up, blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so, this is goodbye
God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh, no, so, this is goodbye
Ooh, I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie, I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so, this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore

Me and you until the end

You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name

And now it's all just a shame

Let me paint this picture for you, baby (yo, yo) (uh)
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him all you get is a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody to cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody that could come and make it right
But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
See, see (uh)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(Ha, what goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
Take it to him
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Take it to him
See (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You should have listened to me, baby
Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey) Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Uh
Hey girl
Because what goes around comes back around

How to Save a Life,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it′s just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you′ve told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he′s just not the same
And you′ll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"

Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you

Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Walk Away (Remember Me) (feat. The DEY),"I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do
I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
Walk away (forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)
Our life from day to day
Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on, but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead
Before we play?
Show up on my doorstep
With a bouquet
Does he call me in the middle of the day
Just to say, baby, I love you
Like you used to?
I can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)
I think about it every day (every day)
And even though we've moved on (moved on, uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
Walk away, walk away (forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me, my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose the love that was meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her, and wish that it was you that I'm kissin'
Sometimes I miss him, and wish that it was you that I'm missin'
Sometimes I hug her, and wish that it was you that I'm huggin'
And I realized how much I'm buggin'
I miss you
So how do I express this feeling?
'Cause nobody compares to you
And you know that she'll never love you like I do
I think about it every day (every day, yeah)
And even though we've moved on (yeah)
It gets so hard to walk away
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
Walk away (walk away)
Walk away (walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)
I can't explain this feeling
I think about it every day (every day)
And even though we've moved on (yeah)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna
Remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me"

Teardrops On My Guitar - Radio Single Remix,"Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see"
Shut Up And Drive,"I've been looking for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
Got a sunroof top and a gangster lead
So if you feel it, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause it's 0 to 60 in 3.5
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive
I got class like a '57 Cadillac
And overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would
So if you feel it, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine

Shut up and drive, drive, drive
'Cause your Maybach ain't got what I got
Get it, get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot
Ain't a Ferrari, huh, boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside
And ride, ride, ride
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights

LoveStoned / I Think She Knows (Interlude),"Hey!
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be going home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's going home with me tonight
Hey, those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's going home with me tonight
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's going home with me tonight, oh
Hey, those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare(cause a glare)
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare(stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere

Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad and she knows

Bleeding Love,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen, ooh
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy, oh
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Oh yeah
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, hey, oh
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love"

Didn't think I'd turn around and say
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Too late, oh
I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat

I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think it was you

Take A Bow,"Oh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah
Standin' ovation
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please
Just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, oh
Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talkin' 'bout, ""Girl, I love you, you're the one""
This just looks like a re-run
Please
What else is on? Oh, oh
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining

Goes to you (goes to you)
For makin' me believe
That you could be
Faithful to me

Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"
I Kissed A Girl,"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"

Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here

Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me
That she wants to own me
To control me
Come closer

Oh I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop

I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me
Come closer

Bubbly,"Will you count me in?
I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place
It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers, staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... Mmm
And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go, I always know
'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while"
I'm Yours,"Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
(I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free
(No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
(It cannot wait, I'm sure)
So please don't, there's no need
(There's no need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate
(Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short
(This is our fate)
This is, this is, this is our fate

Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours
You best believe, best believe I'm yours"

I keep coming back for more
Keep my head in the fire
Sooner or later I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed the truth is a
Stranger soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one

You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'm sick of playing all of these games
Its not bout taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver, it hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I got to be strong and leave you behind
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one

Stop And Stare,"This town is colder now

It's time to make our move
I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see
They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight tags I never thought I could
Steady feet don't fail me now,
I'm gonna run till you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out, and I'm standing down.
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone get scared
But I've become what I can't be
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair

And take your money"
Hot N Cold,"You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no

Our Song,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walkin' up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again, play it again
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
Damaged,"Do, do you got a first aid kit handy?

You try to gain my trust
Talking is not enough
Actions speak louder than words
You gotta show me something
My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again

That my heart is damaged, damaged
So damaged, so damaged

How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it? (it′s that type of pain, makes you pray, makes you cry)

My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged (it's gonna be alright one day)

My heart is damaged

Sometimes, you′ve gotta go through the pain to experience the joy
This too shall pass, then you came

This too shall pass"
Like You'll Never See Me Again,"If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for
I don't want to forget the present is a gift
And I don't want to take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day
Here's not really guaranteed
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh
How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day
Here's not really guaranteed
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Can you do that for me baby?
Every time you touch me
See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know
Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Teardrops On My Guitar - Radio Single Remix,"Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see"

Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one
Thinking that I deserve it

And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
I couldn't turn on the TV (No)
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in and I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is Imma be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you

And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

One Step At a Time,"Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time
You believe and you doubt
You're confused, and got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew
You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time
When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight (when you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time
Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly

It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

Love Story,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, ""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
Just Fine,"You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna... Ooh!
Let it go
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, go do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we

It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

Can't Help but Wait,"I can't help but wait
Oh, I can't help but wait
Check it out, uh
I see you, you're with him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right 'round and forgive
I can't take to see your face with those tears runnin' down your cheeks
But what can I do? I gotta stay true, 'cause deep down I'm still a G
And I don't wanna come between you and your man

'Til you see that with me it ain't the same (can't help but wait)
'Til you see you for what you really are (baby girl, you are a star)
And I can't help but wait
It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You're a queen, you should be getting all that someone's got
You should be rockin' the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional ""I love you, I'm thinking of you""
And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no

7 Things - Single Version,"Sha, sha, sha
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it, if you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
Sha, sha, you do, ohh, ooh
La, la, la
Ooh, ooh"

Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

I'm Yours,"Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
(I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free
(No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
(It cannot wait, I'm sure)
So please don't, there's no need
(There's no need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate
(Our time is short)
'Cause our time is short
(This is our fate)
This is, this is, this is our fate
I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours
You best believe, best believe I'm yours"

You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor

You belong with me
You belong with me

In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?

You Found Me,"I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone, smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you when everything was fallin' apart?
All my days were spent by the telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losin' her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Early mornin', the city breaks
I've been callin' for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages, you never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve, takin' all I want
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but

Circus,"There′s only two types of people in the world

I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I′m ready to break
I′m like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don′t stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared

I run a tight ship, so beware
I′m like the ring leader, I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I′m ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don′t stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus

Let′s go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin′ this (like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like-like-like-like a circus)

Party In The U.S.A.,"I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

I Hate This Part,"We're drivin' slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slippin' through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slippin' through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothin's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sunset in your eyes
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger (can't take this)
All we do is linger (slippin' through our fingers)
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to (goodbye now)
Find a way that I can tell you
That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it, oh

I hate this part right here

I think you should know that I see other people and they see me looking back
Baby, don't you break my heart I told you that it's made of glass
I'm a make it fast, up the empty gas
Look at the past blast, I'm a make you fall on your ass
Suck it up and pacify, but it's irrelevant
Y'all motherfuckers do it for the hell of it
Say you care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, you sigh
(Ah) Care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, you die
(Ah) Care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, side by side
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me

Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"
Right Now (Na Na Na),"It's been so long

Fireflies,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said, ""Farewell"" (they said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

She Wolf,"Sigilosa al pasar
Sigilosa al pasar
Esa loba es especial
Mírala caminar, caminar
¿Quién no ha querido una diosa licántropa
En el ardor de una noche romántica?
Mis aullidos son el llamado
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado
Al fin he encontrado un remedio infalible que borre del todo la culpa
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz, y tú apenas me das caramelos, ay
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por allá, aunque te maten los celos
Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir
Tengo tacones de aguja magnética
Para dejar la manada frenética
La luna llena, abona fruta
Da consejos y los escucha
Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros
Si acaso me meto en aprietos, también llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos, ni divos, ni niños ricos, yo sé lo que quiero (Ah)
Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal en los brazos de algún caballero
Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir
Cuando son casi la una, la loba en celo saluda a la luna
Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna
Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su próxima presa
Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas
Sigilosa al pasar
Sigilosa al pasar
Esa loba es especial
Mírala caminar, caminar
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir"
Sweet Dreams,"Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my...
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

White Horse (Taylor’s Version),"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late

I Do Not Hook Up,"Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down

There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill

They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight
I can't cook, no, but I can clean up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat as I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now, so love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not hook up, up

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger

Keep your head on my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no

That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with a perfect kiss
Then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I don't care if I never see you again

Teenage Dream,"You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life, now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me, just one touch
Now, baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, will be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me, just one touch
Now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep

Just the Way You Are,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Cooler Than Me - Single Mix,"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all-of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are
'Cause it's your scene (it's your scene)
You got no doubt
But-we all see
You got your head in the clouds
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all-of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey, or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me"

Billionaire (feat. Bruno Mars),"I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday Christmas
Give Travie your wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like 'Here lady have this'
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Ha ha get it? I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, Imma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes
(What you see what you see brah?)
I see my name in shining lights

A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything ha ha)
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up Oprah)
Oh every time I close my eyes

Hittin' my head against the wall
What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My status is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head
What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time (all the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
So I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love
Your drug
Huh your drug
Huh your drug
Huh your drug
Is my love your drug? (what you got boy)
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Hey! Hey!
So...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love...
Your love, your love, your love"

Fireflies,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said, ""Farewell"" (they said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)"

Number one spot and now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong
I was thinking 'bout her (uh), thinking 'bout me (hey)
Thinking 'bout us (us), what we gon' be (hey)

Mine,"Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I remember that fight, two-thirty am
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

You Belong With Me,"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?

Party In The U.S.A.,"I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah

They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

Impossible,"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be

Un-thinkable (I'm Ready),"Ugh, Tez keeps telling me he just turned 30
Having dreams of being single forever he's getting worried
And I'm scared too because I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have come close
Me I have'nt changed much, you know how I play
Better safe than sorry
Instead of searching for substance at every single party
Baby being part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody
That's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm trying to live right and give you whatever's left of me
Cause you know life is what we make it and a
Chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it.
Or let me take it for ya
I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city until we finally decide
I got more than a thing for you, tattoo and ink for you
Right over my heart girl I do the unthinkable
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now
(Drake: You should say it right now)
You ready?
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
(Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it.Let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
(Drake: I can't take it)
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
I know you once said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be""
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(Drake: We should do it right now)
Bay, uh
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
(Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it.Let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready

If you ask me I'm ready

Sweet Dreams,"Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my...
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves too good to be true

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain...
Not even death can make us part

Undo It,"Should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand and I let it slide
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw them in the trash
And I'm not even sad
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always going to be the same
Oh, no, you'll never change
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
You want my future, you can't have it (oh, oh, oh)
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna un-un-un-un-un-undo it
You stole my happy, you made me cry (na, na, na, na, na)
Took the lonely and took me for a ride (na, na, na, na, na)

King of Anything,"Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked
So let me thank you for your time,
And try not to waste anymore of mine
And get out of here fast
I hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction
But you'll never see
You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps
You got the talking down, just not the listening
And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
All my life I've tried to make everybody happy
While I just hurt and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Let me hold your crown, babe"
Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,"Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it
Even if you were a million miles away
I can still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time, you were telling me lies, ay
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown, you made my body feel Heaven-bound
Why don't you hold me? Need me
I thought you told me, you'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
Then I knew right where I fit in
Take me, make me
You know that I'll always be in love with you
Right, 'til the end, ohh
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Anybody could've told you right from the start it's 'bout to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream I'll just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it, don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you (oh, hold on)
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried? Have you ever
Living without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?
La, la

Rolling in the Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love (never had met me)
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
The scars of your love (never had met me)

Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)

Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)

Firework,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst

Clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin'
Rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it movin'
Put your drinks up
It's getting ill
It's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we'd probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night aaway
Grab somebody, drink a little more

That badonka donk
Is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven tray donkey donk
All I need is some vodka, some chonky konk
And watch and she gon' get Donkey Kong
Baby if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me dale
Don't believe me just bet me
My name ain't Keith but I see why you sweat me
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more get on the floor
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),"There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online, I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops, and we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard last Friday night
We went streaking in the park, skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law, always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa
But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night ended up online, I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled

Born This Way,"It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young, ""We are all born superstars""
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on in the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause He made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far""
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (don't be, don't be)
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure, I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin, believe capital H-I-M (hey, hey, hey)
I love my life, I love this record, and
Mi amore vole fe, yah (same DNA)

Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"""
Good Life,"Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city, near Picadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night
Night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please, tell me
What there's to complain about
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, good, good life
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life

The Lazy Song,"Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear I'm not doing anything
Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me, I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chilling in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man
Oh-oh, yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out, ""This is great""
(Oh, my God, this is great) yeah
I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait
Oh-oh-oh, yes, I said it, I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today, I don't feel like doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh

And let everything hang loose

The Edge Of Glory,"This next song is called The Edge of Glory
And I really wanted to play it for everyone tonight, because
It's the second thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa
And I wrote this song about him
So here it is, The Edge of Glory
So Grandma, if you're watching at home
This one's for you
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
One of my favourite memories with my grandpa and my grandma around thanksgiving
And it's actually leading up to Christmastime
That they make these cookies called Pizzelles
And if you're Italian you know what those are, they're like really flat waffles
They're really thin and crisp
My grandpa would always make the Pizzelles
And he always worked the machine and everybody had to
""Move out, get out of the way, outta the way, outta the way""
That was my grandpa, this thing is he made the Pizzelles, so
I don't know why but I'm
Right now I'm just thinking about
Thinking about the Italian cookies
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
Alright, alright
Put on your shades, I know you're dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Oh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment, oh, baby, with you
I'm on the edge, I'm on the edge
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you, with you"

Stereo Hearts (feat. Adam Levine),"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio (come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (sing along like)
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand, hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo"

Jar of Hearts,"I know I can't take one more step towards you

From the ice inside your soul

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good
But, now what the hell
La la la la la la la la"
Written in the Stars (feat. Eric Turner),"Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Let's go
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrap's, brraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman
Where the hells all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break
For a sec' I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say the money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam'
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no-one cares about
You just have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the mane
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way"

For the First Time,"She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack, all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how, how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Trying to make it work, but, man, these times are hard
She needs me now, but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how, how we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling, but we're close to tears, even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time
She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job, but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how, how we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up, you get kicked to the dirt
Trying to make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling, but we're close to tears, even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

Yoü And I,"It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'll give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you
He said, ""Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on""
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love for first time and you said to me
Something, something about this place
Something 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, something about, baby, you and I
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock 'n' roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me A Heart of Gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love for first time and you said to me
Something, something about this place
Something 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, something about, baby, you and I
You and I, you, you and I
You, you and I, you, you and I, I
You and I, you, you and I
Oh yeah, I'd rather die without you and I
C'mon, put your drinks up
We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ
Something, something about the chase, six whole years
I'm a New York woman, born to run you down
So have my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you
You and I, you, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die without you and I
You and I, you, you and I
Nebraska I'd rather die without you and I
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you"

Back To December,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleepin'
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreamin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"
Teenage Dream,"You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life, now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me, just one touch
Now, baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, will be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep

Be your teenage dream tonight

Lights,"I had a way then, losing it all on my own
I had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place, the only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Set Fire to the Rain,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over

Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing gets better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died

Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake"

One More Night,"Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and I go hard
At each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score
You and I get sick
Yeah, I know that we can't do this no more, yeah
But baby, there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know, I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you, ""No""
But my body keeps on telling you, ""Yes""
Try to tell you, ""Stop""
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up
In the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up
Feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell, yeah
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you

Drive By,"On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true 'cause
You moved to west L.A., or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever, to get away from me
Oh, but that one night, was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply Hefty bag
To hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mhmm the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the, ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""More than friends"" at last
Oh, but that one night, is still the highlight
I didn't need you, until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply Hefty bag
To hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me, mhmm the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true, 'cause
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you

Titanium (feat. Sia),"You shout it loud, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose

Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall

I Won't Give Up,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?
Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find
'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough (I am tough) he knows (I am loved)
We got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

Part Of Me,"Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearin' at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh, whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact, you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me (no)
Away from me (no)

No
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version),"I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, ""this is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you, "" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night
But ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight
But ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Oh
I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, ""never say never""
Ah, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting, you know?
Like we are never getting back together, like, ever
we are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
(We) ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (getting back together)
(We) ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh (getting back together)
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together"

The world is ours if you want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby try to understand
Don't wanna break your heart

You told me you never fall in love"
The One That Got Away,"You know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The one that got away
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away"
Feel So Close - Radio Edit,"I feel so close to you right now

Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""

Domino,"I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm about to explode
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running
'Cause you're taking me there
Don't you know
You spin me out of control
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air

Fo' sho three oh five to the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby you're the referee

I don't play football
But I've touched down everywhere (everywhere?) everywhere
I don't play baseball
But I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side
And told me: ""Pit you can have me and my sister""
In Lebanon yeah the women the bomb

Ass Back Home (feat. Neon Hitch),"I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home
And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
Cause they be swallowing it
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home
No one hold me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Aww, let's go
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home."
Wanted,"You know I'd fall apart without you
Don't know how you do what you do
Everythin' that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everythin' that's green, girl, I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget
Baby, I wanna make you feel

When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Baby, I wanna make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
And better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it

Brokenhearted,"Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah
This is more than the typical kinda thing

In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You're replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow
Uh-oh, yup
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I'm pacin'

So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio!
What's the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin' bottles by the phone, oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turned me inside out
That's enough, call me up, baby, I'm in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don't even think you know

This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio
See, I've been waitin' all day, for you to call me, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Stereo Hearts (feat. Adam Levine),"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio (come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (sing along like)
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand, hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo"

Good Girl,"Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you, what you're thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy (you see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me, he's low, low, low
Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he's really good at lying
Yeah, he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don't mean much
Hey, good girl (hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away honey
You don't know where he's been
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to getting on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah yeah yeah, he's low...
Yeah yeah yeah...
Oh, he's no good, girl
Why can't you see?
He'll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, he's no good
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl

Paradise,"When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Sing, la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise""
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise
This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise"
Blown Away,"Dry lightnin' cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed, ""Blow it down""
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked, whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (blown away)
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people call it taking shelter
She called it, ""Sweet revenge""
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away (blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slammin' door blown away (blown away)
'Til there's nothin' left standin', nothin' left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked, whiskey-memory blown away (blown away)
Blown away
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma

Rolling in the Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love (never had met me)
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
The scars of your love (never had met me)
They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)

You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

But still so rare, and I'm in awe
Never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls
Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (turn the lights on)
Oh wo-oh, never-never, never knew love
Oh wo-oh, would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most, ooh
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close, ooh
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack

And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep, can't think about giving it up, ooh

You were right here all along

It′s like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I couldn′t get any bigger (oh-oh)
With anyone else beside me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we′re makin'
Two reflections into one
′Cause it's like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren′t you somethin′, an original?
'Cause it doesn′t seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare
′Cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could
I would look at us all the time

′Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I′m here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

′Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I′m lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I′ll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along, oh

It′s like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (oh-oh)
With anyone else beside me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And now it′s clear as this promise
That we′re making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it′s like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow′s a mystery, oh-ooh
I can see you're lookin′ back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I′m lookin′ right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold (no)
Show me how to fight for now (you show me, baby)
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin′ back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you′re my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

And now it′s clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it′s like you′re my mirror (oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now, I say goodbye to the old me, it′s already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

Girl, you′re my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

You are, you are the love of my life

When I Was Your Man,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"
Cruise - Remix,"Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww yeah"
Roar,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar"
Royals,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood

Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
Oh
Oh (oh, oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Oh
Oh (oh, oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy"
I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version),"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me, e-e-e-e
I guess you didn′t care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me, e-e-e-e

And he's long gone when he′s next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I′d never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he′ll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he′s the reason why
You're drowning, you′re drowning, you're drowning, i-i-i-ing
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see, e-e-e-e

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I′d never been
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I′m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there) so shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh!)
Now I′m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"

Wrecking Ball,"We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don′t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you′re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can′t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazin′ fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in

Wake Me Up,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know"
Clarity (feat. Foxes) - Tiësto Remix,"High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?"

Daylight,"Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go

Applause,"I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, ""Is it right or is it wrong?""
If only fame had an I.V, baby could I bear?
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause, live for the-
Way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

I've overheard your theory, ""Nostalgia's for geeks""
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons fan, suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me
I live for the applause, applause, applause

Sweet Nothing (feat. Florence Welch),"You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now (Me now)
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now (Me now)
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know that words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, sweet nothing
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, sweet nothing"
Summertime Sadness (Lana Del Rey Vs. Cedric Gervais) - Cedric Gervais Remix,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Heart Attack,"Putting my defenses up
′Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I′d have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play ′em like a Ken doll
Won′t wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can′t hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I′m putting my defenses up
'Cause I don′t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I′d have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It′s just not fair, pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air, it feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can′t hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I′m putting my defenses up
'Cause I don′t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I′d have a heart attack

The feelings got lost in my lungs
They′re burning, I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there′s no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames

You make me glow
But I cover up, won′t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
′Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I′d have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I′d have a heart attack-tack
I think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I′d have a heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack"

Counting Stars,"Lately, I′ve been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I′ve been, I've been praying hard
Said, ""No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars""
Yeah, we′ll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I′m not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don′t think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn′t lie, couldn't lie, couldn′t lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I feel your love, and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I′m not that bold
And I don′t think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong

I Cry,"I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace
D.U.I., never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality, see when you're blessed just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince Perries
Buy my mama chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Caught in the middle
I cry, just a little

The Other Side,"In the beginning

Find your hands all over me

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July

Catch My Breath,"I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, Karma comes around
I will spent the rest of my life
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down, it's all so so simple now
You helped me see
The beauty in everything
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life

22 (Taylor's Version),"It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah-ah, ah-ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
22
I don't know about you
22, 22
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22 (Dancing like)
22 (Yeah, yeah)
22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"
Best Song Ever,"Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it
I said, ""can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""never in your wildest dreams""
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes (ooh)
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, ""can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""never in your wildest dreams""
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes (ooh)
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember
How we danced, how we danced (one, two, one, two, three)
How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night (we danced, we danced)
To the best song ever (it goes something like, yeah)
And we danced all night to the best song ever

The A Team,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in the pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die"
Highway Don't Care,"Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back

You're tryin' not to think about what went wrong
Tryin' not to stop 'til you get where you goin'

But I do, I do
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bendin' God's ear talking 'bout me
You're tryin' not to let the first tear fall out
You're tryin' not to think about turnin' around
You're tryin' not to get lost in the sound
But that song is always on
So you sing along
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you baby, oh baby

Brave,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
But don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
Innocence, your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you

All of Me,"What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

Counting Stars,"Lately, I′ve been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I′ve been, I've been praying hard
Said, ""No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars""
Yeah, we′ll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I′m not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don′t think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing

Stay With Me,"Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand

These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?

Royals,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

Wake Me Up,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

Story of My Life,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothin' in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burnin' bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothin' in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, runnin' after you is like chasin' the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)

When I met you in the summer
Summer"
Boom Clap,"Boom, boom, boom, clap
You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Like you are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, uh
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart

Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now"
Burn,"We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing (nothing, nothing)
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something (something, something)
They, they're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race

Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave, no, we just wanna be right now, right, ri-ri-right now
And what we see is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now (no sleeping)

Wrecking Ball,"We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don′t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you′re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can′t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazin′ fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should′ve let you in

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball

Not a Bad Thing,"Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
No I won't fill your mind with broken promises
And wasted time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me"
Roar,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

Classic,"Hey, where's the drum?
Wooo oh
Let's go
Woo girl, you're shinin'
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never goin' out of style
Woo pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile
I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
(Gone plastic)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby you
Baby, you're so classic
Four dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doin' it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman, bringin' glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, how ya
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're class, and baby, you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever 'til we met
A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s
You got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A '70s dream in an '80s vest
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massive
Girl, you're timeless
Just so classic
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, how ya
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (whoa oh)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic
Ooh, classic"
A Sky Full of Stars,"′Cause you're a sky, ′cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
′Cause you′re a sky, 'cause you′re a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don′t care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
′Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you′re a sky, ′cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh-oh
′Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

I don′t care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
′Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

'Cause you′re a sky, you′re a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh"
Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"

Sing,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
If you love me
Come on, get involved

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya.""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh

Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Sing!

I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song looking at you, oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Every timethat you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head (Haha)
I wrote this song just looking at you, oh, oh (Just looking at you girl)
Uh, yeah, the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go (Ha! Acapella on 'em)
They go, oh-oh, oh-yeah
Uh come on, come on, come on
They go"

You can find other fish in the sea

Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

Love Runs Out,"I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's making you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doing this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your 50 thousand clapping like one

'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopheles
But mama raised me good, mama raised me right
Mama said, ""Do what you want, say prayers at night""
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul

Run for God, for fate, for love, for hate
For gold and rust, for diamonds and dust

I'll be the bright in black that's making you run
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it sees my soul

Me And My Broken Heart,"All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
Yeah
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart in this song
How do we call this love
I tried, to run away but your eyes (woah-oh-oh-oh)
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
Uh, maybe some part of you just hates me
You pick me up and play me
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
One time tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love (woah-oh-oh-oh)
It seems like we've been losing control

Animals - Radio Edit,"We're the fuckin' animals
We're the fuckin' animals"
Brave,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
Everybody's been there, everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
But don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
Innocence, your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you"
Sweater Weather,"And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let′s have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I′ll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it′s too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don′t mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
′Cause you love to taste, yeah

These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no

′Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

′Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

'Cause it′s too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

It′s too cold
For you here and now
Let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold
It′s too cold
The holes of my sweater"

When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid

Can't Remember to Forget You (feat. Rihanna),"And I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah
You got a hold on me, I never met someone so different
Oh here we go
You're part of me now
You're part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
I can't remember to forget you
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say
Is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh ooh oh, oh-oh ooh oh
I can't remember to forget you
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"

Blank Space,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers

Love Me Like You Do,"You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)

Take Me to Church,"My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick"", you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"
Lean On,"Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on (hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun

Want to Want Me,"It's too hard to sleep

Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me here, where are you now that I need ya?

Fight Song,"Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn′t say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice?

This time this is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power′s turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don′t really care
If nobody else believes
′Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I′m chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep they say I′m in too deep
And it's been two years
I miss my home
But there′s a fire burning in my bones
I still believe, yeah I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice?

This time this is my fight song
Take back my life song

Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue

But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie
'Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie

Hey baby don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late baby
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie
'Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
'Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done
Come on, say!
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin',
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin',
I know you lie
'Cause your lips are moving
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one

'Cause your lips are moving
Baby don't you know I'm done"

I'm Not The Only One,"You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home"""
Hello,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore

Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Stitches,"I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm ripping over myself
I'm aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to the flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
I got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches, no

Gonna wind up dead

Gotta get you outta my head

Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

Elastic Heart,"And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might've thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart

Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care

Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)

Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

Stay With Me,"Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me?

The Heart Wants What It Wants,"You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairy tale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby)
Like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (oh) like I'm gonna lose you"
Habits (Stay High),"I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around, and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the 'tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive
I make it fast and greasy
I'm numb, and way too easy
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain, oh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you

Oh-oh"
Chandelier,"Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a ""good time call""
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame (ah)
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

Heartbeat Song,"This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
All night long
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'da known where I'd be now
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh I could do this for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long"
Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (you bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
Ghost,"I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
Guess I love living in the sin
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
No more haunting baby
I keep going to the river
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake"
Here,"I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering, I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"
Night Changes,"Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight, doubts are runnin' 'round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost
We're only gettin' older, baby
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"

Love Yourself,"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
You should go and love yourself"
Sorry,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don′t do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I′m missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I′m sorry now?

I′ll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I′ll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I′m sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I′m missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I′m sorry now?
I′m sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
Hello,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

"CAN'T STOP THE FEELING! (from DreamWorks Animation's ""TROLLS"")","Ah, yeah, ah, yeah

Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)

Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?

Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me"

Welcome to my duck off the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home bringing the sad
Soon as these happy faces, you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown, pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax
Welcome to my house
Baby take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't like to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud

Stitches,"I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm ripping over myself
I'm aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to the flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
I got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches, no
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Gotta get you outta my head

"Just Like Fire (From the Original Motion Picture ""Alice Through The Looking Glass"")","Ah
I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm-mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm-mmm

Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I get it all the way
I want it all, mmm-mmm
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it
Just like fire, burning up the way

Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'ma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
And people like to laugh at you 'cause they are all the same, mmm-mmm
See I would rather we just go our different way than play the game, mmm-mmm

Dangerous Woman,"Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business
God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothin' to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Oh, yeah
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you

Here,"I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering, I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"
Same Old Love,"Take away your things and go

Like I'm Gonna Lose You (feat. John Legend),"I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows

Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (lose you)
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby (hey), any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want (say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (all gone)
'Cause no (no), we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (lose you)

Let It Go,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now is the time to let it slide
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me
Come on, let it go

Lost Boy,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even, sometimes, he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, Lost Boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together, we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, Lost Boy"", they say to me

And Lost Boys like me are free

You are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last

Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty"
Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha"
On My Mind,"Oh
Oh oh oh, hey
It's a little dirty how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in the hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand)
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait, I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
'Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it, understand it, understand it
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind (but my heart don't understand)
Why I got you on my mind (you think you know somebody)
You think you know somebody (why I got you on my mind)
You think you know somebody
Ah ah ah ah oh ah"
When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I'd swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
(When we were young)
When we were young
(When we were young)
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
(When we were young)
When we were young
(When we were young)
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"
Hide Away,"Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing now I just don't know where to find them
But I hope they all come out tonight
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about things that do so well
I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie 'cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Will somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away"
Lean On,"Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on (hey)
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We all need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on"

Perfect,"I might never be your knight in shinin' armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure
What you're looking for

And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Shape of You,"The club isn′t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)
You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)
Take my hand, stop, put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I′m singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

One week in we let the story begin
We′re going out on our first date (mm-mm)
But you and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate (mm-mm)

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mm-mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto

Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

Say You Won't Let Go,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

Castle on the Hill,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill"
Paris,"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought
""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'lI say you could do anything
They'lI say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

Praying,"Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become
'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is ""I wish you farewell""
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'
I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own, oh
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I'll bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name
You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is ""I wish you farewell""
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'
Ah sometimes, I pray for you at night, oh
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Whoa oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive
Yeah! (I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin')
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'"
Chained To The Rhythm,"Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white-picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're livin' in a bubble, a bubble

Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb

Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ayy, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
The greed of all the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions (woo)
Turn it up, it's your favorite song (hey-oh-oh)
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion

Starving - Acoustic,"You know just what to say, things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more that I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
So much younger yesterday
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
You you, yeah till I tasted you
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I didn't know till I tasted you

Something inside me's changed

Sign of the Times,"Just stop your cryin′, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you′re wearin' your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain′t really good

We never learn, we′ve been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? The bullets?

Just stop your crying, it′s a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we′ve been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

Just stop your crying, it′s a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it will be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? Your bullets?

We don′t talk enough, we should open up
Before it′s all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It′s just what we know

Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away"
Water Under the Bridge,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woah-woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woah-woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"
Malibu,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky is so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true
In Malibu"
No Promises (feat. Demi Lovato),"Cutting me up like a knife

All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder

Perfect,"I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

′Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I′m dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we′ll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I′ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don′t deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

(No, no, no)

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect

I don′t deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Meant to Be (feat. Florida Georgia Line),"Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash

As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright

Baby, if it's meant to be

But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gonna lie, ain't gonna lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love, show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe
Whoa, hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

Never Be the Same,"Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playing it safe, girl""
""I wanna see you lose control""

Bad At Love,"Got a boy back home in Michigan
And it tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in a garden state
And he told me that we make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah I
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah I
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

Tequila,"I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearin' on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearin' on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were

Back To You - From 13 Reasons Why – Season 2 Soundtrack,"Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself
I don't want it even though I do
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there, wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you"

Wait, if I'm in dicky's body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter's in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?
I woke up in Chris Brown's body (ohh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn
This bitch sideways (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday
Yeah it's Freaky Friday
I'm in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it's my dream dick
If I was Lil dicky in my body, where would I be
I'm trying to find myself like an introspective monk
I'm balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter, fuck
Now I'm at the club, I talked my way to getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won't let me in
I don't know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back
I woke up in Chris Brown's body (ohh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn
This bitch sideways (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday
Wait what the fuck
And now I'm in Ed Sheeran's body
It's way less cool than being Chris Brown was
What the fuck again
I'm DJ Khaled, why am I yelling
Huh, I'm Kendall Jenner
I got a vagina, I'm gonna explore that right now (woo)
Holy shit, I got a vagina (uh)
I'm gonna learn
I'm gonna understand the inner workings of a woman"
Wait,"Dirty looks from your mother

Wolves,"In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you

And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Shape of You,"The club isn′t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)
You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)
Take my hand, stop, put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I′m singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
(Mm-mm)

I′m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I′m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Oh, I'm in love with your body

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh, I′m in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We′re going out on our first date (mm-mm)
But you and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate (mm-mm)

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mm-mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let′s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""

Eastside (with Halsey & Khalid),"Uh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away, away with me
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set"
Call Out My Name,"We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you, so gently
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don′t want me

Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can′t you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won′t you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name and I′ll be on my way, and
I'll be on my-

I said I didn′t feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

Happier,"Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with the all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, that's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)

Everybody says, ""say something""
Say something, say something
Then say something, say something, then say something

Without Me,"Found you when your heart was broke

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky
Does it ever get lonely?

I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah yeah)
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind

My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy

Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy

Happier,"Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with the all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, that's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one

And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away, away with me
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now

Someone You Loved,"I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down

Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign, must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate

And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'

We don't fit in well

Be Alright,"I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me, and I see there's something you're trying to hide, and I
Reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break, you say
The cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's, they were my mate's
And I feel the color draining from my face
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time

Only Human,"Yeah, ayy

It's closing time, so leave with me again (yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an 80s groove (ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk
It's only human, you know that it's real
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh
Early morning la-la-light
Only getting up to close the blinds, oh

'Cause leaving now just don't feel right

How Do You Sleep?,"I'm done hating myself for feeling
I'm done crying myself away
I've gotta leave and start the healing
But when you move like that, I just want to stay
What have I become now?
Looking through your phone now, oh no
Love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Tell me how do you
Love will keep you up tonight
Tell me how do you
Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm sticking around to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Tell me how do you (Yeah)

One Thing Right - Duke & Jones Remix,"I've cheated and I've lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
I've broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door (at my door)
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I change
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (to walk away)
When I was getting crazy, reckless and wild
Acting like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (find its place)
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, I got one thing right
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (But I got one thing right)
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like (mommas don't like)
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (I got one thing right)"
Tequila,"I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearin' on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearin' on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (when I, when I, when I)
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearin' on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila"
All To Myself,"I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearin'
And the way they're holdin' you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on starin'
So lock the door and turn out the night
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talkin'
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singin'
And the way it's rollin' off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinkin'
I don't need nothin' between you
Leanin' for another kiss, yeah
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talkin'
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all
All

To myself, yeah
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmm)

Blinding Lights,"Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Don't Start Now,"If you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now

The Bones,"We're in the home stretch of the high times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Mmm-mmm, mmm
Call it dumb luck, but, baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up although we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it, but the
Wolves came and went and we're still standing
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good
Bones are good, the rest (baby, it don't really matter), the rest don't matter

Someone You Loved,"I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Shows up in a 2AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night

All she wanna do is party all night"
everything i wanted,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

Before You Go,"I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go"
Falling,"My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I′ll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I′ll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drowned out pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I′d never fall again, don′t think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I′m out of my mind, 'cause I can′t get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, ′cause I been feeling ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I′ll give you everything

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I′ll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

I′ll never give my all again
'Cause I′m sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down

Tear me up inside, and you break me down"

Break My Heart,"I've always been the one to say the first goodbye

I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this Earth, hoping you'll find someone else

Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed

Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

Nobody but You,"Don't have to leave this town to see the world

For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me

I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)

Got no regrets, 'cause they got me here

There'd only be one thing
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
I don't wanna live without you (I don't wanna live)

I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as bein' nothin'
I pray to God that He make me a better man, uh
Maybe one day, I'ma stand for somethin'
I'm thankin' God that He made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that Hell for nothin'
I'm always fuckin' up and wreckin' shit, it seems like I perfected it
I offer you my love, I hope you take it like some medicine
You tell me, ain't nobody better than me, I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me, always end up betterin' me
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
We take drugs, then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes, I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong, all along, my fault
My mistakes probably wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby, stay strong, we gon' live long
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one

All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance

But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh, uh, uh

Feeling blessed, never stressed

And nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears
Just like the waves and sound did

I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you

Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause, no, I've had enough of them
Let me start this off by sayin'
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can't, I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

deja vu,"Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends, saying you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her
Almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest
We kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singing it together
Now I bet you even tell her
How you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (ooh) (I love you)
So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're trading jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
(I know you get déjà vu)"

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape

It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

When she asked me, ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

Then you showed up, and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess, and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothing to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all
Sounds so true to me
We don't have nothing to say, hey

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt

How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?
Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks

Before I went and fell in love with you

Don't you dare forget about the way
You betrayed me

For the way I hurt, yeah

When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat

Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive

About her that I feel about you right now

You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool, mm, mm
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you, mm, mm, yeah
Listen
Wish I could quit you, but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would
But somethin' 'bout you makes me think we could
Make it after all
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you
You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool
Yeah, every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you

Ooh, ooh"
Leave Before You Love Me,"I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
I'm so good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no
I'll just catch a ride
I'd rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won't give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be stayin', staying' (dancing on)
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far

Glad You Exist,"Here's to all the late night drunk phone calls that you picked up
Here's to all the bad decisions that you didn't judge
All the 'love you's and the 'hate you's and the secrets that you told me
Here's to everyone but mostly us
There's a couple billion people in the world
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Hey, look what a hello from a stranger turned into
Caught up in a moment like it's just us in this room
All the right words at the right time and you know 'em 'cause you know me
Better than anyone else, we don't need anyone else
There's a couple billion people in the world (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And a million other places we could be, but you're here with me
Take a moment just to take it in (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause every high and every low led to this
I'm just so glad you exist
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go, don't you ever go changin'
Never let me go, never let me go, never let me go, baby
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go, don't you ever go changin'
Never let me go, never ever let me go, never let me go, baby

Lonely (with benny blanco) - Acoustic,"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
I'm so lonely

Kings & Queens,"If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, no, no, no
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves, oh
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget, oh-oh, oh
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
In chess, the king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high

Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it
Go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

Happier Than Ever,"When I′m away from you, I'm happier than ever

To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mmm

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue)
When you (when you) said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you′d do)
And I′d end up more afraid

Don't say it isn′t fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I′m away from you (when I'm away from you)
I′m happier than ever (happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-mmm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I′m wasting my breath
′Cause you only listen to your fucking friends

I don't relate to you
I don′t relate to you, no
'Cause I′d never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
′Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don′t have
And don′t try to make me feel bad

I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line ′cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you ′cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone"
