"Old Hits Medley (The Way You Look Tonight, Theme from a Summer Place, When I Fall in Love)","Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm,
Just the way you look tonight"
Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,"Do do do
Down dooby doo down down
Comma, comma, down dooby doo down down
Comma, comma, down dooby doo down down
Breaking up is hard to do
Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know
I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again
I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on, baby, let's start anew
'Cause breaking up is hard to do
Now I know
I know that it's true

Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

"Puff, the Magic Dragon","Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys
One gray night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon, sadly slipped into his cave
Oh, Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Puff the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee"
Blowin' in the Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind"
Shut Down - 2021 Stereo Mix,"Tack it up, tack it up
Buddy, gonna shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Two cool shorts standin' side by side
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
A revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean
Tack it up, tack it up
Buddy, gonna shut you down
Declinin' numbers at an even rate
At the count of one we both accelerate
My stingray is light the slicks are startin' to spin
But the four-thirteen's really diggin' in
Gotta be cool now
Power shift, here we go
Superstock dodge is windin' out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin, ' that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor, hear the dual quads drink
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel-injected engine sittin' under my hood
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down

She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge
Last time I saw Marie she was wavin' me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
We were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
She tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please
You got to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee"

That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm ridin' 'round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me
Baby, better come back maybe next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak?
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey

I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction

Like a Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel, ah how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone"

But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout a rock 'n' roll
If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow sorta late at night
And we'll go dancing baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music, and the music's in me
Yeah, do you believe in magic
Yeah, believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

Bus Stop,"Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say
""Please, share my umbrella""
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
Under my umbrella
All that summer, we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
And that umbrella, we employed it
By August, she was mine
Every mornin', I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same
That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinkin' of a sweet romance
Beginning in a queue
Came the sun, the ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow
Every mornin', I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same
On bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say
""Please, share my umbrella""
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows
Under my umbrella
All that summer, we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August, she was mine"
"Paint It, Black","I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I've seen people turn their heads
And quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens everyday
I look inside myself
And see my heart is black
I see my red door
I must have it painted black
Maybe then, I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing
Happening to you
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes
I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I wanna see it painted
Painted black
Black as night
Black as coal
I wanna see the sun
Blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black, yeah"
Daydream,"What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowin' the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn
I've been havin' a sweet dream
I been dreamin' since I woke up today
It's starrin' me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for droppin' my load
A pie in the face for bein' a sleepy bull toad
And you can be sure that if you're feelin' right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom-made for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy"
I Am a Rock,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island
I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pains
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"
Did You Ever Have to Make up Your Mind?,"Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?
Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says ""Better go home, son, and make up your mind""
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?"
Homeward Bound,"I'm sittin' in the railway station
Got a ticket to my destination
On a tour of one-night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin'
Silently for me
Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin'
Silently for me
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escapin'
Home where my music's playin'
Home where my love lies waitin'
Silently for me
Silently for me"

19th Nervous Breakdown - Mono Version,"You're the kind of person you meet at certain dismal, dull affairs
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud, running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years
And though you've tried you just can't hide your eyes are edged with tears
You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
When you were a child you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys but still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax
You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh please
You were still in school when you had that fool who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back on treating people kind
On our first trip I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after a while I realized you were disarranging mine
You better stop, look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh please

They'll stone you just like they said they would

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door
But I would not feel so all alone

Yellow Submarine - Remastered 2009,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life

In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

Along Comes Mary,"Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me
And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks , and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks
Whose sickness is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes
As who is most to blame today
And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers
Will make them not the same
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
And when the morning of the warning's passed, the gassed
And flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone
The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars
And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies, and make them
Realize their urgent cry for sight no more
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch"
Wouldn't It Be Nice - Remastered 2000 / Stereo Mix,"Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray
It might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
(We could be married)
And then we'd be happy
(And then we'd be happy)
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?

Good night my baby

A Well Respected Man,"'Cause he gets up in the morning,
And he goes to work at nine,
And he comes back home at five-thirty,
Gets the same train every time.
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality,
It never fails.

And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.
And his mother goes to meetings,
While his father pulls the maid,
And she stirs the tea with councilors,
While discussing foreign trade,
And she passes looks, as well as bills,
At every suave young man.
'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.
And he likes his own backyard,
And he likes his fags the best,
'Cause he's better than the rest,
And his own sweat smells the best,
And he hopes to grab his father's loot,
When Pater passes on.
'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
Doing the best things so conservatively.
And he plays at stocks and shares,
And he goes to the regatta,
And he adores the girl next door,
'Cause he's dying to get at her,
But his mother knows the best about
The matrimonial stakes.
'Cause he's oh, so good,
And he's oh, so fine,
And he's oh, so healthy,
In his body and his mind.

Doing the best things so conservatively."
I'm a Believer - 2006 Remaster,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Still, I'm gonna miss you
""There's no time to lose, "" I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still, I'm gonna miss you
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday

For What It's Worth,"There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind
It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
What a field day for the heat (Ooh ooh ooh)
A thousand people in the street (Ooh ooh ooh)
Singing songs and they carrying signs (Ooh ooh ooh)
Mostly say, ""Hooray for our side"" (Ooh ooh ooh)
It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away
We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?
You better stop

Brown Eyed Girl,"Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping and you
My brown-eyed girl
And you, my brown-eyed girl
And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl
Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da
Just like that
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da, la-tee-da
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl
Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da

Still so far away

Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going 'round

'Round and round and round and round
round and round and round and round with you

Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die

Alfie,"What's it all about Alfie
Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about
When you sort it out, Alfie
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if, if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above
Alfie, I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed
You're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day Alfie, Alfie"

It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky
For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon
Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us
Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly

Penny Lane - Remastered 2009,"Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say, ""Hello""
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a Mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane, is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then, the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane"

White Rabbit,"One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small
When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know
When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head"

Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,

Honey,"See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad,
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited,
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart,
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
'Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you and I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of a day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you and I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it,
Was just a twig"

I'll be with you when the stars start falling
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love
I'm with you my love
The light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love
It's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you 'til my seas are dried up
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love"

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I want you, hello, I need my baby
Hello, hello, hello, hello"
Midnight Confessions - Single Version,"The sound of your footsteps
Tell me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, babe
Brings out a need in me that nobody hears, except
In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you
There's a little gold ring you wear on your hand
Makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
Staggering through the daytime
Your image on my mind
I'm passing so close beside you, baby
'Cause sometimes the feelings are so hard to hide, but

(Theme From) Valley of the Dolls,"Gotta get off, gonna get
Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get
Need to get hold of my pride
When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name
When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
What's in back of the sky, why do we cry
Gotta get off, gonna get
Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get off, gonna get
Need to get on where I'm bound
When did I get, where did I
Why am I lost as a lamb
When will I know, where will I
How will I learn who I am
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
Tell me, when will I know, how will I know
When will I know why"

Pictures of Matchstick Men - Mono Version,"When I look up to the sky
I see your eyes, a funny kind of yellow
I rush home to bed, I soak my head
I see your face underneath my pillow
I wake next morning, tired, still yawning
See your face come peeping through my window
Pictures of matchstick men and you
Mirages of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you
Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction now
When will this haunting stop?
Your face, it just won't leave me alone
Pictures of matchstick men and you
Mirages of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you
You in the sky, you with this guy
You make men cry, you lie
You in the sky, you with this guy
You make men cry, you lie

I've Gotta Get A Message To You,"The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Said, ""Come and walk with me
Come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime
There's no time for the phone""
I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart
Then won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just go to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
Well I laughed but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying but deep down inside
Well I did it to him
Now it's my turn to die
I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I've just got to get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on"
Lady Madonna - Remastered 2015,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet"
Hurdy Gurdy Man,"Thrown like a star in my vast sleep
I opened my eyes to take a peek
To find that I was by the sea
Gazing with tranquility

Came singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Came singing songs of love
""Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy"" he sang
""Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy"" he sang
""Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy"" he sang
Histories of ages past
Unenlightened shadows cast
Down through all eternity
The crying of humanity
'Tis then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love
""Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy gurdy"" he sang

Magic Carpet Ride,"I like to dream, yes, yes
Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free
Close your eyes, girl
Look inside, girl
Let the sound take you away
Last night I hold Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me, little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

Sky Pilot,"He blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease
And their bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them be wanted
He's a good holy man
Sky pilots
Sky pilots
How high can you fly?
You never, never, never reach the sky
Beside that the young soldiers
Tell them it's alright
He knows of their fears
In the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood
And many will die
Mothers and Fathers
Back home they will cry
Sky pilots
Sky pilots
How high can you fly?
You never, never, never reach the sky
He mumbles a prayer
And it ends with a smile
The order is given being
Moved down the line
But he'll stay behind
And he'll mediate
But it won't stop the bleeding
Or ease the hate
As the young men move out
Into the battle zone
He feels good with God
He's never alone
He feels so tired
And he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
In the words that he said
Sky pilots
Sky pilots
How high can you fly?
You never, never, never reach the sky."
Over You,"Why am I losing sleep over you?
Reliving precious moments we knew
So many days have gone by
Still, I'm so lonely and
I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time
Out of my mind over you
Within the prison walls of my mind
There's still a part of you left behind
And though it hurts, I'll get by
Without your lovin' yet
I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time
Out of my mind over you
And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time
Out of my mind over you
And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time
Out of my mind over you"

"Woman, Woman","This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearranged
And she would never be the same again
This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live
This girl tasted love
As tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear
A teardrop that was sweet and warm
Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died
A woman had been born
This girl is a woman now

White Room,"In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves
At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves"
Do You Know the Way to San Jose,"Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
LA is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose
Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?
Oh, LA is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh, do you know the way to San Jose?
Can't wait to get back to San Jose"
Scarborough Fair / Canticle,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (in the deep forest green)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground)
Without no seams nor needle work
(Bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(A sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(And polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(Blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(A cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine"
Piece of My Heart,"Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on

Honey, you know I did
And each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed
You're out on the streets looking good
And baby, deep down in your heart, I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe, and I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I said come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well, you know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good
I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby (whoa, break it)

Honky Tonk Women,"I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis

It's the honky tonk women

Hands, touching hands
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holding you
One, touching one
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

To believe they never would
Oh no, no

Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River
Well
Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, ""You're gonna find the world is smoldering
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River""
Well

Waiting for you to come
Longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come
And bring all your love to me

Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill

When you are near to me
I am in ecstasy (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'd swallow the pain and pride

Traces,"Faded photographs, covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half, memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love long ago that didn't work out right
Traces of love
Ribbons from her hair, souvenirs of days together
The ring she used to wear, pages from an old love letter
Traces of love long ago that didn't work out right
Traces of love with me tonight
I close my eyes and say a prayer that in her heart
She'll find a trace of love still there somewhere, oh
Traces of hope in the night that she'll come back and dry
These traces of tears from my eyes, oh, yeah"

When I left Galveston
Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston
I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun
At Galveston, at Galveston"

Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head - Rerecorded,"Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
Till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me"

Will never disappear

It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Snowbird,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring
When I was young
My heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing that I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again
Should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird
Take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you
Yeah, if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you"
"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother","… The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where, who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
… So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
… For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
… If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
… It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
… And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
… He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother"

Lola - 2020 Stereo Remaster,"I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A, Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola

Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said ""Dear boy, won't you come home with me?""
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Well, I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said ""Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man""
Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola

Fire and Rain - 2019 Remaster,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows, when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby
One more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now"

It's Too Late,"I feel the earth move under my feet

Ooh baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way, hey
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Oh darlin', when you're near me

Down to my very soul

All over, all over, all over, all over
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down

Stayin Alive,"I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?
How can you mend a this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, la-la, la-la, la
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow?
So how can you mend a broken heart? And mine is
How can you stop the rain from falling down? Baby
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round? And sometime I have to say, yeah, say

"Take Me Home, Country Roads","Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home

Knock Three Times,"Hey, girl, whatcha doin' down there?
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you
I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me
You don't even know me
I love you
Oh, my darling
Knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, hmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Ohh, ohh, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show
If you look out your window tonight
Pulling the string with the note
That's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence, I adore you
And only in my dreams did that wall
Between us come apart
Oh, my darling
Knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, hmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Ohh, ohh, twice on the pipe

Me and Bobby McGee,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way into New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I's holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no-no
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby, kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
That feelin' good was good enough for me, mmm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say and as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know

For only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know"
If You Could Read My Mind,"If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I am a ghost, you can't see
If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstore sells
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two, a movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back"
Rainy Days And Mondays,"Talkin' to myself and feelin' old

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothin' is really wrong
Feelin' like I don't belong
Walkin' around
Some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me)
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out (talk it out)

Don't Pull Your Love Out,"Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears
You say you're gonna leave
Gonna take that big white bird
Gonna fly right out of here
Without a single word
But you know you'll break my heart
When I watch you close that door
'Cause I know I won't see you anymore
Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears
Haven't I been good to you
What about that brand new ring
Doesn't that mean love to you
Doesn't that mean anything
If I threw away my pride
And I got down on my knees
Would you make me beg you pretty please
Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears
There's so much I wanna do
I've got love enough for two
But I'll never use it, girl, if I don't have you

It Don't Come Easy,"It don't come easy, you know it don't come easy
It don't come easy, you know it don't come easy
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy
Forget about the past and all your sorrow
The future won't last, it will soon be your tomorrow
I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it just ain't easy
Open up your heart, let's come together
Use a little love and we will make it work out better
Got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy
Please remember peace is how we make it
Here within your reach, if you're big enough to take it
I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it don't come easy"
Mr. Bojangles - Remastered 2001,"I knew a man ""Bojangles"", and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
And then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As the smoke ran out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name ""Bojangles"", and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and feathered stance
Oh, he jumped so high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
He danced for those in minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died, he up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said, ""I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit""
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him ""Please""
Please

I Don't Know How To Love Him,"I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes, really changed
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man, he's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love?
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
What's it all about?
If he said he loved me
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
Oh, I want him so
I love him so"

Me and You and a Dog Named Boo,"I remember to this day
The bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Willpower made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that so
Oh, how I wish we were back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man
Now I can still recall
The wheat fields of St. Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old McDonald, he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man
Now I'll never forget the day
We motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settlin' down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's buggin' us to go
We gotta get away and get back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land

How I love being a free man"
If,"If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me to
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me
If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"

One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Who do you love? I hope it's me
I've been changing, as you can plainly see
I felt the joy and I learned about the pain
That my momma said
If I should choose to make a part of me
Would surely strike me dead
And now I'm one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
I sail away a country mile
And now I'm returning and showing off my smile
I met all the girls and I loved myself a few
And to my surprise
Like everything else I've been through
It opened up my eyes
And now I'm one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Don't you know I'm just waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Don't you know I'm just waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line
I want to be one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line
Waiting for the train that goes home
Hoping that the train is on time
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over line
One toke, one toke over the line"
Watching Scotty Grow,"There he sits with a pen and a yellow pad,
He's a handsome lad, that's my boy.
P-r-l-f-q, spells mom and dad.
Well, that ain't too bad, 'cause that's my boy.
You can have your T.V. and your night clubs.
You can have your drive in picture shows.

Lonely Days,"Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning, outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Lonely days, lonely nights.
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights.
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights.
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights.
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?"
Won't Get Fooled Again - Original Album Version,"We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgement of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
A change, it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again, no, no
I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half-alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do you?
Yeah
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are effaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again, no, no
Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss"
I Am...I Said - Single Version,"L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
And the feeling is ""lay back""
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back
Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still
Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one
But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
""I am""... I said
""I am""... I cried
""I am"""

Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door?

Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door?
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door?

One Less Bell To Answer,"One less bell to answer...
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy
But all I do is cry
(Cry cry no more laughter)
Oh, I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go?)
I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run (I still run)
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
'Cause I still love him so
(Love him so)
I end each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out
Oh...
One less man to pick up after...
No more laughter...
No more love... (no more love)
Since he went
Oh, he went away
(He went away)
(One less bell to answer)
Why did he leave me?
(Oh why why did he leave?)
Now I've got one less egg to fry (one less bell to answer)
One less egg to fry
(Oh why why did he leave?) And all I do is cry
(One less bell to answer) Because my man told me goodbye
(Oh why why did he leave?)
(One less bell to answer) Somebody tell me please where did he go? why did he go?
(Oh, why?) Tell me how could he leave me
(Why did he leave?)"
Riders on the Storm,"Riders on the storm

Into this house, we're born

An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love
To the dark and the endless skies
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last 'til the end of time my love
And it would last 'til the end of time
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face, your face, your face"
Alone Again (Naturally),"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to whoever
Wants to know what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Were people saying, My God, that's tough
She stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about, God in His mercy
Oh, if he really does exist
Why did he desert me
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that
There are more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do
What do we do
Alone again, naturally
Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
American Pie,"Long long time ago, I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
Did you write the Book of Love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Then I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the King and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh and while the King was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book of Marx
The Quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singing, bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
Helter skelter in the summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die""
This will be the day that I die
They were singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die"""
Without You,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
Can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
Can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Baby Don't Get Hooked on Me,"Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes
And it's startin' to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me
Just keep it friendly girl
'Cause I don't wanna leave
Don't start clingin' to me girl
'Cause I can't breathe
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Girl you're a hot-blooded woman, child
And it's warm where you're touchin' me
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile
You're seein' way too much in me
Girl don't let your life
Get tangled up with mine
'Cause I'll just leave you
I can't take no clingin' vine
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby don't get hooked on me
Baby baby don't get hooked on me"
Brandy (You're a Fine Girl),"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whiskey and wine
The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loved
He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home
The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea""
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea""
It is, yes it is
He said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"""

Nights In White Satin - Single Version / Mono,"Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through
They can't understand
Some try to tell me
Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end
And I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
Yes I love you
Yes I love you
Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you
Breathe deep the gathering gloom
Watch lights fade from every room
Bed sitter people look back and lament
Another days useless energy spent
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none
New mother picks up and suckles her son
Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colors from our sight
Red is gray and yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is an illusion"
Sunshine (Go Away Today),"Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing

When I grow up, I'm going to make it mine
But these aren't dues I been paying
How much does it cost, I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
But he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine
Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
Don't know what he's asking
Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
He says in love and war all is fair
But he's got cards he ain't showing
How much does it cost, I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine
Sunshine come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells'll be ringing"

Morning Has Broken - Remastered 2021,"Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the world
Sweet the rains new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dewfall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass
Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day
Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the world"
Everything I Own,"You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you
And I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go
And I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Is there someone you know
Your loving them so
But taking them all for granted?
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say
I would give anything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"
Mother and Child Reunion,"No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine
I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again
No, I would not give you false hope (no)
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine
I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again
But I would not give you false hope (no)
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away (oh oh)
Oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh (oh), the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away
Oh, oh, the mother and child reunion
Oh, is only a motion away
Oh, the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away (way, way, way)"

You said, you'd give to me
As soon as you were free

You told me that you didn't love him

Why did you have to lie?
Where is the love?
You said, was mine, all mine
Till the end of time
Was it just a lie?
Where is the love?
If you had, had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hangin' on the promises
You've got to let me know
Oh, how I wish, I never met you
I guess, it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love

Layla,"What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned my whole world upside down
Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Before I finally go insane
Please don't say I'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why
Closer than the leaves
On a weeping willow, baby, we are
Closer, dear, are we
Than the simple letters A and B are

All your life you could love only me
Tell me why then, oh why should it be that

You Don't Mess Around with Jim,"Uptown got it's hustlers
The bowery got it's bums
42nd street got big Jim walker
He's a pool shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come
But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim boss, just because
And they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well outta south Alabama came a country boy
He say I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool shootin' boy
My name Willie McCoy
But down home they call me slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd street
He drivin' a drop top cadillac
Last week he took all my money
And it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back
And everybody say Jack don't you know
And you don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim
Well a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' were done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet
Yeah he were cut in in bout a hundred places
And he were shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor now they say
You don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim
Yeah, big Jim got his hat
Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two piece custom made pool cue
Yeah you don't tug on superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the old lone ranger
And you don't mess around with slim"
Anticipation,"We can never know about the days to come

And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me
But I, I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinkin' about how right tonight might be
Anticipation, anticipation
Is makin' me late
Is keepin' me waitin'
And tomorrow we might not be together

Saturday in the Park - 2002 Remaster,"Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs
Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it? (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
And singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today
Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no, no
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, people touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all

If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it? (yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day"
Family Affair - Single Version,"It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn
Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Over there, over there
Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh-huh
You can't leave 'cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay 'cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry 'cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway 'cause you're all broke down

Taxi,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light
Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window
She said, ""16 Parkside Lane""
Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more
It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same
And she said, ""How are you, Harry?""
I said, ""How are you, Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you""
It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far
You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky
Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind
Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'til my time runs out
Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes, she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying, aren't we all?
There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns
And she said, ""We must get together""
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me 20 dollars for a 250 fare
She said, ""Harry, keep the change""
Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt
And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago
You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky
And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned"
I Saw the Light - 2015 Remaster,"It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you
Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)
Though we had our fling (we had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)
'Til that little bell began to ring (began to ring)
In my head, in my head
But I tried to run (I tried to run)
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (not help me none)
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said
But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)
But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes
And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light
In my eyes? (In my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)"
Doctor My Eyes,"Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?
'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me
Doctor, my eyes
They cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?"
I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony),"I'd like to build a world a home

And snow white turtle doves

In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company
I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace throughout the land
That's a song I hear
Sing it along
Let the world sing today
Over and over

Vincent,"There was a boy
Very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
Though we talked of many thing, fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china-blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch this world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
A silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will
You're gonna do that for me?
I'm gonna do this for you"
Speak To The Sky,"Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong
And you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air
And the world will look better from up there
Speak to the sky 'cause things can get ya down
And you know when you're talkin' to the Lord, to the Lord
The world will look better than before
And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind
Or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
And though my conversation doesn't always rhyme
I always try to find some time to
Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel
And to know sometimes what I say ain't right
It's all right
Cause I speak to the sky every night
And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind
Or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
And though my conversation doesn't always rhyme
I always try to find some time to
Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel
And to know sometimes what I say ain't right
It's all right
Cause I speak to the sky every night
Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong
And you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air
And the world will look better from up there"
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown","Well, the south side of Chicago

Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Well Friday 'bout a week ago

And at the edge of the bar

Well, he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown had learned a lesson
'Bout a-messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And meaner than a junkyard dog"
You're so Vain,"Son of a gun
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you?
You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you

Well I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with some underworld spy
Or the wife of a close friend wife of a close friend and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you don't you?
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
Probably think this song about you
You're so vain"
Delta Dawn,"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
She's 41 and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks 'round Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
In her younger days, they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?"
Little Willy,"North side, east side
Little Willy, Willy wears the crown, he's the king around town
Dancing, glancing
Willy drives them silly with his star shoe shimmy shuffle down
Way past one, and feeling alright
'Cause with little Willy round they can last all night
Hey down, stay down, stay down down
'Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
Up town, down town
Little Willy, Willy drives them wild with his run-around style
Inside, outside
Willy sends them silly with his star-shine shimmy shuffle smile
Mama done chase Willy down through the hall
But laugh, Willy laugh, he don't care at all
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down
'Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy 'round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no

We're An American Band - Remastered 2002,"Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie, doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact
Up all night with Freddie King
I got to tell you, poker's his thing
Booze and ladies, keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective, he was outta sight
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, ""Come on dudes, let's get it on""
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down
We're an American band

Rocky Mountain High,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain high (Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
While they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky Mountain high
Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high in Colorado)"

Danny's Song,"People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun, I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like you and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love, the sun is gonna shine above
And even though we ain't got money

Everything bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me every thing's gonna be all right
Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up, love him and he'll bring you luck
And if ya find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah 'n don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own
And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with ya honey
Everything bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes

Bring a tear of joy to my eyes

Smoke on the Water,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile, yeah
We didn't have much time now
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
(Smoke) on the water, you guys are great
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
He was pulling kids out the ground now
When it all was over
Find another place
Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Burn it down
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
The Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Huh, making our music there now
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
(I can't hear anything)
one more time
(Smoke on the water) hey!"
Your Mama Don't Dance,"Your mama don't dance

When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?
The old folks say
That ya gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin'
You know you're gonna lose and never win
I'll say it again
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?
You pull into a drive-in
And find a place to park
You hop into the backseat
Where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move-in
Thinking it's a breeze
There's a light in your eye
And then a guy says
Out of the car, long hair
Louie, you're coming with me
The local police
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll

Get Down,"Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more

You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around
You give me the creeps
When you jump on your feet
So get down, get down, get down
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds
Once upon a time, I drank a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby, what do you think you're doing to me
Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around, around
I still want you around

And I'd like you, if you can
To get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around

Reelin' In The Years,"Your everlasting summer and you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something that you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine
You've been telling me you're a genius since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine
I've spent a lot of money and I've spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen you find another man
The things you think are useless I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine"
Yesterday Once More,"When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile.
Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well.
Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine.
When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more.
Lookin' back on how it was
In years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed.
It was songs of love that
I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away.
Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine.
All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry.
Just like before
It's yesterday once more."
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"He was a famous trumpet man out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft, but then his number came up
And he was gone with the draft, he's in the army now a blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he could not jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar
In boogie rhythm, he can't blow a note unless a bass
And guitar is playin' with him and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
When he played his boogie woogie bugle, he was busy as a busy bee
And when he played he made the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
Andata toodliata-toodliata, toot, toot, he blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
'Cause they know how it goes when someone gives him a beat
Woh, woh, he wakes 'em up when he plays reveille
The boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
A root, a toot, a toodli-a-da to, toot, toot, toot, he's blowin' eight to the bar
Can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't, woh, with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B"
Clair,"Clair
The moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me
Which I couldn't see
And then, the moment I met you, again
I knew in my heart
That we were friends
It had to be so
It couldn't be no
But try as hard as I might do
I don't know why
You get to me in a way
I can't describe
Words mean so little
When you look up and smile
I don't care what people say
To me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair
If ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you
In all that you do
But why in spite of our
Age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you
I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me
Than hearing you say
I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me, Uncle Ray?
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair
I've told you before
Don't you dare
Get back into bed
Can't you see that it's late
No you can't have a drink
Oh all right then
But wait just a minute
While I, in an effort to babysit
Catch up on my breath
What there is left of it
You can be murder
At this hour of the day
But in the morning the sun
Will see my lifetime away
Oh, Clair
Clair
Oh, Clair"
Do It Again,"In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water
And you fire 'til he is done in but they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street
You go back, Jack, do it again, wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again
When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two-timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin' you'll be on your knees tomorrow, yeah
You go back, Jack, do it again, wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again
Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin' man
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey, you must put them on the table
You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again"
Kodachrome,"When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
Give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away

Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome, mm

That I was born a ramblin' man
Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of a gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down highway 41
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin'
I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man
Alright
I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always having a good time down on the bayou
Lord, and Delta women think the world of me
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin'
I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man"
Peaceful,"In the morning fun when no one will be drinking any more wine
I'll wake the sun up by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup
And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow
And I can wait for fate to bring around to me any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow
'Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here
In the evening shadows are callin' me and the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday when my plans were giggled in rhyme
I had a son while on the run and his love brought a tear to my eye
And maybe some day he'll up and say ""We had a pretty nice time"", oh, oh, oh, my
'Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here"

Don't Expect Me to Be Your Friend,"I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you aren't home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
'Cause I'd hear laughter coming through your door
Sometimes late at night you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep
You make me vow to try and stop by sometime
But baby that's a promise I can't keep
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect to me to be your friend
I don't walk down through the village or other places
That we used to go to all the time
I'm trying to erase you from my memory
'Cause thinking of you jumbles up my mind
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect me to be your friend
You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way you take my hand and then
Introduce me to your latest lover

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect me to be your friend"

Why does anyone do anything?
I don't know, I was really drunk at the time
Just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two
He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven

It Never Rains in Southern California,"Got on board a westbound 747
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Oh, that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
Out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm underloved, I'm underfed
I wanna go home
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell 'em how you found me
Don't tell 'em how you found me
Gimme a break, give me a break
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California

It pours, man, it pours"
The Twelfth Of Never,"You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you, oh, my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you till the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you till the poets run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time"
The Way We Were,"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"

One Hell Of A Woman,"She's a woman
She's a baby
She's a witch
She's a lady
She's a free and gentle spirit
She can be what she wants to be
And if she wants to be with me tonight

Sunshine On My Shoulders,"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high

Time in a Bottle,"If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure, and then
Again, I would spend them with you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty
Except for the memory of how they were answered by you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with"
Annie's Song,"You fill up my senses

Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again
Come, let me love you
Let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter
Let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you
Let me always be with you
Come, let me love you
Come love me again
Let me give my life to you
Come, let me love you
Come love me again
You fill up my senses

Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again"

Surely, you know I'll always want to be there
Holding your hand and standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through in everything you do
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right (make it right)
Let me take you through that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there (oh, let me be there)
Watching you grow and going through the changes in your life
That's how I know I'll always want to be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there

Sundown,"I can see her lying back in her satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
She's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain
I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her loving is your first mistake
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winning, when I'm losing again
I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard-loving woman, got me feeling mean
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs

And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees, and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be, just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

The Air That I Breathe - 2008 Remaster,"If I could make a wish
I think I'd pass
Can't think of anythin' I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you
Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel
Go to sleep

And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you

You And Me Against The World,"Tell me again, mommy
You and me against the world
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world
When all the others turn their backs and walk away
You can count on me to stay
Remember when the circus came to town
And you were frightened by the clown
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for
You and me against the world
Sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried I always felt that
God was on our side
And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world
And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world
I love you, mommy
I love you too, baby"
Takin' Care Of Business,"You get up every morning from your alarm clock's warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushin', people shovin'
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day
And I'll be taking care of business (every day)
Taking care of business (every way)
I've been taking care of business (it's all mine)
Taking care of business and working overtime, work out
If it were easy as fishin' you could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a second-hand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
Tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid, and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day
And we be taking care of business (every day)
Taking care of business (every way)
We be been taking care of business (it's all mine)
Taking care of business and working overtime

Whoo
All right
Take good care of my business
When I'm away, every day
Whoo

Radar Love,"I've been drivin' all night, my hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby callin', sayin', ""I need you here""
And it's a half past four and I'm shiftin' gear
When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable, coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all
We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love
The radio's playin' some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speedin' into a nude sunrise
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing tthat's called a radar love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar love
No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars go down real slow, woah
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a thing that's called
Radar love"
Please Come to Boston,"Please come to Boston for the Springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lotsa room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a café where I hope to be workin' soon
Please come to Boston
She said ""No-would you come home to me?""
And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy now wontcha settle down?""
""Boston ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
""I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""
Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night till they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said ""No-boy, would you come home to me?""
And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy why dontcha settle down?""
""Denver ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
"" 'cause I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""
Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to
Somebody I can sing to
Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA
She just said ""No-boy, would you come home to me?""
And she said, ""hey ramblin' boy why dontcha settle down?""
""LA can't be your kinda town""

Oh Very Young,"Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
You're only dancin' on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your dads best jeans
Denim blue, faded up to the sky
And though you want them to last forever
You know they never will
You know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still
Oh very young what will you leave us this time
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you, will you ride the great white bird into heaven
And though you want to last forever
You know you never will
You know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride, oh, ooh
Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
You're only dancin' on this earth for a short while
Oh very young, what will you leave us this time"
Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress),"Big ole Ruby red dress wanders round the town
Talkin' to herself now, sometimes sittin' down
Don't you get too close now, Ruby runs away
Poor ole Ruby red dress born on a sorry day
I can hear her say
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, now leave me alone
Oh leave me alone, please leave me alone, yes leave me
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, now leave me alone
God leave me along, just leave me alone, oh leave me
Big ole Ruby red dress, everybody laughs
Say she's got no future and never made no past
Something hurt that Ruby, something she can't bear
You look at her real close now, you see a little tear
Oh when she says now
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone now, God leave me alone
Oh leave me alone, just leave me alone, please leave me
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, now leave me alone
Oh leave me along, just leave me alone, oh leave me
Some folks say some farm boy up from Tennessee
Taught it all to Ruby, then just let her be
Her Daddy tried to hide it, tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby, she broke down to a fool
Who just said now
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, now leave me alone
Oh leave me alone, please leave me alone, yes leave me
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, now leave me alone

(I've Been) Searchin' So Long - 2002 Remaster,"As my life goes on I believe
Somehow something's changed
Something deep inside
Ooh a part of me
There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life
Changing me
I've been searchin'
So long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning, oh
Now I see myself as I am

I will understand
What I left behind

Good things

Can you boogie, can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my
You can boogie, if you try

I Shot The Sheriff,"(I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!

Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down,
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy, but I say
Oh, now, now, oh!

(But I swear it was in self defense) Oh, no! (Oh, oh, ooh)
Yeah, I say, I shot the sheriff oh, Lord! (And they say it is a capital offense)
Yeah! (oh, oh, ooh) Yeah!
Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know,
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow,
He said kill them before they grow, and so
Read it in the news! (I shot the sheriff) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defense)
Where was the deputy? (Oh, oh, ooh)
I say, I shot the sheriff,
But I swear it was in self defense, yeah! (Ooh)
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot, I shot, I shot him down and I say,
If I am guilty I will pay!
,
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh) oh no!
(I shot the sheriff) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh (Oh, oh, ooh)
Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be,
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out, I say
I, I, I, I, shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy, no
I, I (shot the sheriff)
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah

And I want to try for you, 'cause
I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long

Summer thunder on moon bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I

Hello It's Me,"Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
It's important to me
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

But I believe you really ought to know
I love you

You don't have to answer, I see it in your eyes
Maybe, it's better left unsaid
This is pure and simple and you must realize
That it's coming from my heart, and not my head
I love you
I honestly love you
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along every day
And I shouldn't blow my chance
When you've got the chance to say
I love you
I love you
I honestly love you
If we both were born in another place in time
This moment might be ending with a kiss
There you are with yours and here I am with mine
So, I guess, we'll just be leaving it at this
I love you

Rhinestone Cowboy,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow in the rain
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And the smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Who went our separate ways

You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name
Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce about the girI miss
And the love I left behind
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you

You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

Laughter In The Rain,"Strolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside
After a while we run under a tree
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love

When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play Sally Goodin all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ol' fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, woo
Well I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's a mighty keen
Well, son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ol' fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's 'til the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, ""live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy""
Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work to play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me an ol' fiddle
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny funny riddle
Woo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes"

The Best of My Love - 2013 Remaster,"Every night i'm lyin' in bed
Holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
Comin' apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin' to give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces and loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh... whoa oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
Oh... whoa oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
I'm goin' back in time and it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night and I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping
But every mornin' I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today?
You see it your way I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
(Ooh...) I guess that wasn't enough oh-oh ooh whoa
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

And the feelin' just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Hey, wontcha play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song?
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong

He Don't Love You (Like I Love You),"He don't love you like I love you

He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart
Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'

For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating, woah
I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down, 'cause
He don't love you like I love you
'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart
He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Woah, but he's has so many rehearsals, girl
To him it's just another play, but wait
When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home
He don't love you like I love you (and he never will)
'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Oh, he don't love you, girl, like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart
Woah, he don't love you"
Angie Baby,"You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock n' roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched, you know, Angie baby
Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more, Angie baby
Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe
Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At the night through her window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby
(Angie baby, Angie baby)
When he walks in her room he feels confused
Like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found
The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie baby
Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)
Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)
(Angie baby, Angie baby)
(Angie baby, Angie baby)"
Jackie Blue,"Ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of her room
Hides a smile when she's wearin' a frown
Ooh, Jackie you're not so down
You like your life in a free-form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup
Ooh, Jackie Blue
What's a game girl, if you never lose?
Ask a winner and you'll probably find
Ooh, Jackie they've lost at sometime
Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a natural thing
Like playing music, but you never sing
Ooh, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Ooh, Jackie Blue, you're going again
Ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like sifting through sand
Ooh, Jackie, it slips through your hand
Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time
Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, hey"

Sister Golden Hair,"Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed
That I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar but I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes?
I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
Will you meet me in the middle?
Will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little?
Just enough to show you care?
Well, I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Now I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind
Will you meet me in the middle?
Will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little?
Just enough to show you care?
Well, I tried to fake it
I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it"
Mandy,"Siempre he de recordar
Lluvia helada al caer
En la oscuridad
Un rostro aparece
Llora su pesar, la noche acaba
Llega un nuevo amanecer
Gente alegre vuelvo a ver
Y en su mirar
Observo lo que fue
No supe interpretar felices momentos
Oh, Mandy
Diste, aun sin pedir nada a cambio
Pero te rechacé
Oh, Mandy
Me besaste, calmaste mi angustia
Me haces falta, lo sé, oh, Mandy
Más allá del tiempo estoy
Y aquello añoro hoy
Preso en confusión de este mundo así
Vuelvo a recordar aquella tristeza
Oh, Mandy
Diste, aun sin pedir nada a cambio
Pero te rechacé
Oh, Mandy
Me besaste, calmaste mi angustia
Me haces falta, lo sé, oh, Mandy
Todo quedó atrás, y amanece
Brisa que al pasar se compadece
Oh, Mandy
Diste, aun sin pedir nada a cambio
Pero te rechacé
Oh, Mandy
Me besaste, calmaste mi angustia
Me haces falta, lo sé
Oh, Mandy
Diste, aun sin pedir nada a cambio
Pero te rechacé
Oh, Mandy"
Have You Never Been Mellow,"There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you
Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?
Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand, hey
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?"
Cat's in the Cradle,"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, dad""
""You know I'm gonna be like you""
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw, I said-a, not today
I got a lot to do, he said, that's okay
And he, he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
It said, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?
He shook his head, and they said with a smile
What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then, dad
You know we'll have a good time then
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to, dad, if I can find the time
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad
It's been sure nice talking to you
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then, dad
We're gonna have a good time then"
Wildfire,"She comes down from Yellow Mountain
On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night
Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down its stall
In a blizzard, he was lost
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
By the dark of the moon, I planted
But there came an early snow
Been a hoot-owl howling outside my window now
'Bout six nights in a row
She's coming for me, I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go
We'll be ridin' Wildfire
We'll be ridin' Wildfire
We'll be ridin' Wildfire
On Wildfire we're gonna ride
We're gonna leave sodbustin' behind
Get these hard times right on out of our minds
Riding Wildfire"

When will I be loved
I've been put down, I've been pushed 'round

I've been made blue, I've been lied to

Always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
Tell me when will I be loved"
Please Mr. Please,"In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox
With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when yours are through
I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am just missing you again
Please Mr. please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please Mr. please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again
If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee
But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind
Please Mr. please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please Mr. please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again"

Don't Call Us (We'll Call You),"A long distance directory assistance, area code 212
And say, hey, A&R, this is Mister Rhythm and Blues
You said, ""Hello"" and put me on hold
To say the least, the cat was cold
He said, ""Don't call us, child, we'll call you""
I said, ""You got my number?""
He said, ""Yeah, I got it when you walked in the door""
Don't call us, we'll call you

You remember the all night creature from Stereo Ninety Two?
Yeah, I said, ""Could you relate to our quarter track tape
You know the band performs in the nude""
He said, ""Uh-huh, don't call us, child, we'll call you""
Woo
Well, listen, kid, you paid for the call
You ain't bad but we've heard it all before
And it sounds like John, Paul and George
Child, anyway
Anyway, we cut a hit and we toured a bit
With a song he said he couldn't use
And now he calls and begs and crawls
It's telephone déjà vu
We got percentage points and lousy joints
And all the glitter we can use, mama
So, ha, don't call us now, we'll call you
Woo
You may hear this one too before I said, you know
I said, listen, kid, you paid for the call
Hell, well you ain't bad but I've heard it all before, uh

Standing all alone
You gave all the love that I needed
So shy, like a child who has grown
Lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling, clear and lovely
You're my lady
Lady, turns me on when I'm lonely
Show me all your charm
Evenings when you lay down beside me
Just take me gently into your arms
You're my lady of the morning

Bungle in the Jungle - 2002 Remaster,"Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree
Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, I thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes
The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And he who made kittens put snakes in their grasp
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
And I'm a snake when we disagree, yes
Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes

My motto's always been 'when it's right, it's right'
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be there any way
Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting
Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always though a fish could not be caught who wouldn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might try nibbling
A little afternoon delight
Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Please be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We could make a lot of lovin' 'for the sun goes down
Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting
Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight!"
Get Closer,"Darlin', if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin', if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin', if you want me to love, love only you, then love only me
Darlin', if you want me to see, see only you, then see only me
There's a line, I can't cross over
It's no good for me and it's no good for you
And there's a feelin' deep down inside me
I can't explain it and you're wondering why
You say we've been like strangers
But I'm not the others you can wrap 'round your fingers
Darlin', if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin', if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin', if you want me to love, love only you, then love only me
Darlin', if you want me to see, see only you, then see only me
There was a time (yeah, baby)
I would come runnin'
Drop everything for the touch of your hand in mine
You were blind
And now you regret it
'Cause I can't forget it
It's locked in my mind
And I can't go on livin'
Day to day, wondering if we'll be here tomorrow
People change and you're changin'
And I've given you my all
There's no more to borrow
Darlin', if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin', if you want me to be (want me to be)
Closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' (darlin') if you want me to be (want me to be)
Closer to you, get closer to me (closer, closer)
Darlin' (darlin') if you want me to be (want me to be)
Closer to you, get closer to me"
Bohemian Rhapsody - Remastered 2011,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

I'd Really Love to See You Tonight,"Hello, yeah, it's been a while
Not much, how 'bout you?
I'm not sure why I called
I guess, I really just wanted to talk to you
And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for a while
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile
I'm not talking 'bout moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see, it really doesn't matter much to me
I'm not talking 'bout moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
I won't ask for promises
So, you don't have to lie
We've both played that game before
Say ""I love you"", then say ""Goodbye""
I'm not talking 'bout moving in (I'm not talking)
And I don't want to change your life ('bout changing your life)
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight (I'd really love to see you tonight)
I'm not talking 'bout moving in (I'm not talking)
And I don't want to change your life ('bout changing your life)
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight (I'd really love to see you tonight)

Love Hurts,"Love hurts, love scars

I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Ooh, ooh, love hurts
Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true

Take It to the Limit - 2013 Remaster,"All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman
Who might have loved me
I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer (spent my life running round)
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same
So put me on a highway
Show me a sign
Take it to the limit
One more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back
You're running back
You're coming back for more...
Put me on a highway
Show me a sign

Moonlight Feels Right,"The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your okay
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right
We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
'Cause southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
A class of seven four, gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right
We'll see the sun come up on sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
'Cause me and moon are itching to play

Only Sixteen,"She was only sixteen, only sixteen

And I was too young to know
We'd laugh and we'd sing and do funny things
And it made our hearts glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
So why did I give my heart so fast
It never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen
I've aged a year since then
She was only sixteen, only sixteen
Ooh, with eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
So why did I give my heart so fast
It never will happen again
But I was a mere child of sixteen
I've aged a year since then
Now she was only sixteen, only sixteen

Without your precious love, your tender touch
Hey, little girl, I miss you so much
Wish we could turn back the hands of time
To the day when you were mine
You used to call me angel face
Used to call me angel face
You used to help me through the night
Make me feel all right

I can't get ya out of my mind

Weaker every day.
I guess I'm not as strong,
As I used to be,
If you use me again,
It'll be the end of me.
'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.
'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.
Say that you love me,
Say that you love me,
Say that you love me.
Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin',
Fallin' fallin' fallin'."
Devil Woman,"I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Stay away, look out
If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighborhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you"
Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel - Pt. 1,"Heaven, must be missin' an angel

Shop Around,"When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said, ""Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.
And then she said, ""Just because you've become a young man now,
There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now.""
My mama told me, ""You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)
Ah, there's somethings that I want you to know now.
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell em that you love em so now.
My mama told me, ""You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)
A-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.

Evil Woman,"You made a fool of me
But them broken dreams have got to end
Hey woman, you got the blues
Yes you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha ha woman it's a crying shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman
Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found that fool lyin' in a daze
Ha ha woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
Yes you better get your face on board the very next train
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha ha funny how you broke me up
You made the wine now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha ha very nice to know
That you ain't got no place well left to go
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman

And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is to darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

Got To Get You Into My Life - Remastered 2009,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?"
Fanny (Be Tender With My Love),"First I rise, then I fall
Seems like you don't want the love
Of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine (ooh)
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me
So you say to yourself, boy
You're out of your brain
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
All night in the rain?
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want I'll take you there (ooh)
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me (ooh)
With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh, with our love
You made a promise
You'll always love me forever

She's Gone,"Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what's right for me
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me
Sorry Charlie for the imposition
I think I've got it, got the strength to carry on
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh what will be
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
Get up in the morning look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken her toll on me
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
But they can never be what she was to me
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone (she's gone)

Still the One,"We've been together since way back when
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whisperin' in my ear
You're still the one I want to talk to in bed
Still the one that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (Wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow
You're still the one that makes me laugh
Still the one that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one that makes me strong
Still the one I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (Yes, you are)
Changing, our love it comes and goes
Even though we grow, it grows too
You're still the one that I love to touch
Still the one and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one who can scratch my itch
You're still the one that I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You are still the one that makes me shout
Still the one that I dream about
We're still having fun, and you're still the one
You're still the one
Yeah, still the one
We're still having fun
And you're still the one"

Far away, from the city
Don't Hesitate,

Ooh baby I love your way,
I Wanna tell you I love your way,
I Wanna be with you night and day
Moon appears to shine, and light the sky,
With the help, of some fireflys

I Can see them, under the pine
But Don't hesitate,

Clouds are stalking islands in the sun,
I wish I could buy one, out of season,
But don't hesitate,

Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again,"Doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today
Could ya maybe give me something?
'Cause the feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees that I've been
Up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
All around tryin' to get the feelin' again
The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high, low
Everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
I read every book
Looked through every meditation and poem
Just to bring back home that old sweet sensation
But it ain't no use to me trying to get that feeling again
Up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
Up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
Where did it run to? I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the love light burnin'
But whatever I've done I guess, I just haven't done it too good
'Cause all that's left is yearnin'
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
All around tryin' to get the feelin' again
The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high and low
And everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
And I've been lookin', I've been lookin', I've been lookin'

Squeeze Box,"Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box

Country Boy (You Got Your Feet In L.A.),"Livin' in the city
Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on
But the job demands that you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone
You get a house in the hills
You're payin' everyone's bills
And they tell you that you're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
""Is that who you really are?""
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home
Talkin' on the telephone
Settin' up another day of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Stayin' in touch with the street
When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
'Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
""Is this what it's all about?""
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own"
Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright),"Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door, too

Loosen off that pretty French gown

Ooh baby don't you hesitate 'cause
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Come on angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire

Spread your wings and let me come inside, 'cause

"Evergreen (Love Theme from, ""A Star Is Born"")","Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen"
(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher,"Your love is liftin me higher, than I've ever been lifted before
Your love is liftin me higher, than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire and I'll be at your side forever more
Now once, I was downhearted, disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed and he never showed his face again
Oh, I'm so glad I finally found you, you're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again
Your love is liftin me higher than I've ever been lifted before (higher)
So keep it up, quench my desire and I'll be at your side forever more (higher)

Torn Between Two Lovers,"There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word, let me tell you ""I love you""
Let me hold you close, and say these words as gently as I can
""There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me, and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill""
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules
You mustn't think you failed me just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules
Couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules

Margaritaville,"Are you ready?
Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of you Parrotheads covered with oil
And feathers, and signs, and pins
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginnin' to boil
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know this is somebody's fault
I don't know the reason
Stayed here all season
With nothing to show but that brand new tattoo
Hell yes, it hurts
But it's a real beauty
Oh, I think she might be a Nantucket cutie
Or maybe she's from the Vineyard
I haven't got a clue
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
I agree with that
And I know it's all you women's fault
Coming soon
Old men in tank tops
Cruisin' the gift shops
The lost verse
Checkin' out chiquitas down by the shore
I found 'em, I found 'em
They dream about weight loss, oh
Wish they could be their own boss
Those three day vacations become such a bore
I blew out my flip flop
Stepped on a pop top
I broke my leg twice, I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
That's where this ship is headed
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damn fault
That's what the therapist said, hell
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
They're always in
And I know it's my own damn fault
Welcome home, everybody
Salt, salt, salt
Lucky we stayed
Thank you all very much
You sure make a, a boy from Mississippi
Feel right at home in Wisconsin
Thank you all
I love my job
Thank you
Thank you again, Parrotheads
Not only for tonight, but 30 years of doing this, uh
I just feel very lucky to be doing it
Here's a little song to send you on your way
Thank you again, everybody
We love you"

Hotel California - 2013 Remaster,"On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax, "" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"""
Southern Nights,"Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze

Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so
Southern nights

I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In southern skies)
Its precious beauty lies
Just beyond the eye it goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old
Old man
He and his dog, that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy
Feel so good
Feel so good, It's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da...

On And On,"Down in Jamaica
They go lots of pretty women
Steal your money
Then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with old Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan
On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on
Poor old Jimmy
Sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder
Steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry
On and on
He just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on
When the first time is the last time
Can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight
Don't let her say goodnight
Got the sun on my shoulders
And my toes in the sand
Woman's left me for the some other man
Aw, but I don't care
I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart and see where it lands
On and on

Couldn't Get It Right,"Time was drifting, this rock had got to roll
So, I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, really got a hold
I started searching for a better way
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right
Philly Fever, made me feel alright
But, I must admit it got the best of me
Gettin' down so deep I could've drowned
Now, I can't get back the way I used to be
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right
New York City took me with the tide
And, I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no account fatality
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But, I couldn't see the light, no, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right, couldn't get it right
I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night

I am so into you, yeah
I am so into you"
Dreams - 2004 Remaster,"Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
But it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell, dreams of loneliness?
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh-oh-oh, you'll know"
I'm In You,"I don't care where I go when I'm with you
When I cry you don't laugh cause you know me
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
You and I don't pretend; we make love
I can't feel anymore than I'm singing
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
Come so far when you think
you think back
You can't buy what we made, you and I
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had"
Lucille,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a barstool, she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her she said ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""
In the mirror, I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking, his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the barroom
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time
""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"""
Handy Man,"Hey girls, gather round
Listen to what I'm puttin' down
Hey, baby, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind that uses pencil or rule
I'm handy with the love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know I truly can
If your broken heart, she needs repair
Then I'm the man to see, I whisper sweet things
You tell all your friends, they'll come running to me
Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy twenty four hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come

Just a Song Before I Go,"Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned
When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone
She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies
Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone
Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned"
You and Me,"When I get home from work,
I want to wrap myself around you.
I want to take you and squeeze you
Till the passion starts to rise.
I want to take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.
But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some lovin',
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
Well that's enough for me.
Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling,
I want to reach out and touch you,
But you just go on dreamin'.
If I could take you to heaven,
That would make my day complete.
You and me ain't no super stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some popcorn,
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
You're just enough for me.
When I get home from work,
I want to wrap myself around you.
I like to hold you squeeze you
Till the passion starts to rise.
I want to take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.
But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
Some lovin',
And TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
Well that's enough for me."
Lonely Boy,"He was born on a summer day 1951
And with a slap of a hand
He landed as an only son
His mother and father said what a lovely boy
We'll teach him what we learned
Ah yes just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly and
We'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight
To be nobody's fool
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
In the summer of '53 his mother
Brought him a sister
And she told him we must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you
Well he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh how could his parents have lied
When they said he was an only son
He thought he was the only one
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Goodbye mama, goodbye to you
Goodbye papa I'm pushing on through
He left home on a winter day 1969
And he hoped to find all the love
He had lost in that earlier time
Well his sister grew up
And she married a man
He gave her a son
Ah yes a lovely son
They dressed him up warmly
They sent him to school
It taught him how to fight
To be nobody's fool
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy"
Don't Stop - 2004 Remaster,"If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't you look back
(Ooh)
Don't you look back
(Ooh)
Don't you look back"
Barracuda,"So this ain't the end, I saw you again, today
I had to turn my heart away
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails
You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, barracuda? Oh
Back over time we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me, uh-huh
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, barracuda, oh yeah
""Sell me, sell you"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep now to save my head, you
I think that you got the blues too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools
The real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ohh, barra-barracuda, yeah"
You're My World,"You're my world, you're every breath I take
You're my world, you're every move I make
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies
But for me, they shine within your eyes
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world
End of my world
End of my world for me"
Heard It in a Love Song,"I ain't never been with a woman long enough
For my boots to get old
We've been together so long now
They both need resoled
If I ever settle down
You'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me
To head on down the line
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
I'm the kind of man who likes to get away
Like to start dreaming about tomorrow, today
Never said that I love you, even though it's so
Where's that duffle bag of mine, it's time to go
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
I'm gonna be leaving at the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman tagging along
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder
And I guess I always will
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong"
Carry on Wayward Son,"Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more
No more"
New Kid in Town - 2013 Remaster,"There's talk on the street it sounds so familiar
Great expectations everybody's watching you
People you meet they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new
Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down
You look in her eyes the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics here we go again
But after awhile you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend
Oh
Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you?
When you're not around...
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night you're willing to hold her just hold her
Tears on your shoulder
There's talk on the street it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along
Where you been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him don't they?
(A-a-h...) And he's holding her
And you're still around...
Oh, my-my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town...

Everybody's talking 'bout
The new kid in town

(Ooh hoo) Everybody's walking like
The new kid in town

There's a new kid in town

There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town

My Heart Belongs to Me,"I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me
Can we believe in fairy tales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin', the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me
But now my love, hey didn't I love you?
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me, don't ask why
Can't hide the feeling, the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me
(But know my love, hey didn't I love you?
Didn't I love you? Didn't I love you? Didn't I love you, baby?)
Don't cry my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
My heart belongs to me
I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me"
Jet Airliner,"Leavin' home, out on the road
I've been down before
Ridin' along in this big ol' jet plane
I've been thinkin' about my home
But my love light seems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
You know I've got to be movin' on
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
I might get rich you know I might bet busted
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
As I get on the 707
Ridin' high I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell
Before you get to heaven
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Touchin' down in New England town
Feel the heat comin' down
I've got to keep on keepin' on
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around
And I'm goin' with some hesitation
You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
Funky shit goin' down in the city
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, oh big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away

Weekend in New England,"Last night I waved goodbye now it seems years
I'm back in the city where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you bringing us near
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again
Time in New England took me away to long rocky beaches you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again
I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I have
With you there's a heaven
So earth ain't so bad
And tell me when will our eyes meet when can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again again"
Ariel,"Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl she sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Standing by the water fall in Paramus Park
She was working for the friends of BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup
She was looking for change and so was I
She was a Jewish girl, I fell in love with her
She wrote her number on the back of my hand
I called her up, I was all out of breath
I said, ""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band""
I took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans
I picked her up in my new VW van
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath
I said ""Hi"", she said, ""Yeah, I guess I am""
Ariel, Ariel
We had a little time, we were real hungry
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat
She had some onion rings, she had a pickle
She forgot to tell me that she didn't eat meat
I had a gig in the American Legion hall
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps
She was sitting in a corner against the wall
She would smile and I melted all over the floor
Ariel, Ariel
I took her home with me, we watched some TV
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady
I started fooling around with the vertical hold
We got the munchies and I made some spaghetti
We sat and we talked into the night
While channel two was signing off the air
I found the softness of her mouth
We made love, the bombs bursting in air
Ariel, Ariel, Ariel, Ariel
Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl
She sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria"
Lost Without Your Love,"Lost and all alone
I always thought that I could make it on my own
But since you left I hardly make it through the day
My tears get in the way, and I need you back to stay
I wonder through the night
And search the world for the words to make it right
All I want is the way it used to be
With you here close to me
And I've got to make you see
That I'm lost with out your love
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of
I'm as helpless as a ship without a wind
A touch without a feel
I can't believe its real
And someday soon I'll wake and find my heart won't have to break
Yes, I'm lost with out your love
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of
All I want is just the way it used to be
I need you here with me
Oh darling can't you see
If we had love before we can have it back once more"

Love So Right,"She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend, started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke-up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me
How a love so, right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong?
Where did she go, when I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
It isn't really fair
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right, can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?"
I Never Cry,"If there's a tear on my face
It makes me shiver to the bone
It shakes me, babe
It's just a heartache that got caught in my eye
And you know I never cry, I never cry
Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TV's dead and gone
I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
And the night may pass me by
But I never cry
Take away, take away my eyes
Sometimes I'd rather be blind
Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't you leave it alone
'Cause that's all I got to give you
Believe me, babe, it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin, it ain't never been tried

Walk This Way,"Now there's a backseat, lover
That's always undercover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, ""you ain't seen, nothin'
'Til you're down on the muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways""
Now there's a cheerleader
That's a real big pleaser
As far as I can reminisce
And the best thing of loving
Was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this
See-saw swingin'
With the boys in school
And her feet was flyin' up in the air
Singin', ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
And they swingin' like it just don't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Well, just gimme a kiss!
Ooh, a-like this!
School girl sleazy
With a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hangin' way up her knee
There were three young ladies
In the school gym locker
And they find they were lookin' at D
I was high school loser
Never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
That my next door neighbor
Had a daughter, had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this
See-saw swingin'
With the boys in school
With your feet was flyin' up in the air
Singin', ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
I was swingin' like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
When she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
She told me to

Year of the Cat,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat
She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat
While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat
Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the newborn day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the year of the cat
Year of the cat"
Go Your Own Way - 2004 Remaster,"Loving you
Isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things
That I feel?
If I could

How can I
When you won't take it from me?

Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up
Shacking up is all you want to do
If I could
Baby, I'd give you my world
Open up
Everything's waiting for you

Don't Worry Baby,"Well it's been building up inside of me

And makes me realize when she says

Ev'rything will work out all right
Don't worry baby (oh)
I guess I should-a kept my mouth shut
When I start to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because I
Pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to drive when she says
Don't worry baby
Ev'rything will work out all right
Don't worry baby (oh)
She said now baby when you race today
Just take along my love for you
And if you knew how much I loved you baby
Nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me

I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head
And in a world of people, there's only you and I

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night

I was doing you no harm

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down

You Light Up My Life,"So many nights I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now you've come along
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home?
Finally a chance to say, ""Hey, I love you""
Never again to be all alone
'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life"

Tells you all of his dreams

I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No it just ain't true
I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about ev'rything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now
Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about ev'rything
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone
When you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home"
Can't Smile Without You,"You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you
You came along just like a song
And brighten my day
Who would have believed that you were part of a dream
Now it all seems light years away
And now you know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile
Now some people say
Happiness takes so very long to find
Well, I'm finding it hard
Leaving your love behind me
And you see I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel glad when you're glad
I feel sad when you're sad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you"
Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,"Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears
And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad ('cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville
Hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box
I can't lie (I can't lie)
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere"
Sometimes When We Touch,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you, honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you
'Til the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth
Sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you
'Til the fear in me subsides
At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you
'Til the fear in me subsides"
Hopelessly Devoted To You - From “Grease”,"Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
I know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see there's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
My head is sayin', ""Fool, forget him""
My heart is sayin', ""Don't let go
Hold on to the end"", that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's no way to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm outta my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you"
Hot Blooded,"Well, I'm hot-blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come, baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot-blooded, I'm hot-blooded
You don't have to read my mind, to know what I have in mind
Honey, you oughta know
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show
Now it's up to you, we can make a secret rendezvous
Just me and you, I'll show you lovin' like you never knew
That's why, I'm hot-blooded, check it and see
Feel the fever burning inside of me
Come, baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot-blooded, hot-blooded (I'm hot)
Now it's up to you, can we make a secret rendezvous?
Oh, before we do, you'll have to get away from you know who
Well, I'm hot-blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on, baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot-blooded, I'm hot-blooded
I'm a little bit high
(Hot-blooded) you're a little bit shy
(Hot-blooded) you're making me sing
(Hot-blooded) for your sweet, sweet thing
(Hot-blooded) do you hear what I say?
(Hot-blooded)"
You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim) - Acoustic Version,"I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bossed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're an essay in glamor
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen
And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul"
Magnet and Steel,"Now I told you, so you ought to know (ooh)
It takes some time for a feeling to grow (ooh)
But you're so close now I can't let you go (ooh)
And I can't let go
to show the way I feel
(With you, I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel
I can't hope that I'll hold you for long (ooh)
You're a woman who's lost to your song (ooh)
But the love that I feel is so strong (ooh)
And it can't be wrong
to show the way I feel
(With you, I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel
to show the way I feel
(With you, I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel
For you are a magnet and I am steel
For you are a magnet and I am steel"
Love Will Find A Way,"Someone, someone's got me wrong
You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feelin' like such a fool
Poor you, you're thinkin' maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool um hm
Oh but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way
Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new yes you do
Your dreams feel like they're fallin' apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself
Oh, but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
So now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through
Again yes 'cause it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way"
An Everlasting Love,"I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever hold me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
I've got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need
It's the only show
And it's you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold, give me what I've waited for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born
And you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try
I've got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need
It's the only show
And it's you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die"
Goodbye Girl,"All your life you've waited for love to
Come and stay
And now that I have found you, you must
Not slip away
I know it's hard believin' the words you've
Heard before
But darlin' you must trust them just once
More, 'cause baby
Goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't
Be long away
'Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl
Will bring me back to you.
I know you've been taken, afraid to hurt
Again
You fight the love you feel for me instead
Of givin' in
But I can wait forever, a-helpin' you to see
That I was meant for you and you for me so remember
Goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart you still
Will have my heart
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl
'Cause now you're home at last."
Slip Slidin' Away,"Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Delores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again
He's slip slidin'
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
Mmm"
Imaginary Lover,"Imaginary lovers
Never turn you down
When all the others turn you away
They're around
It's my private pleasure
Midnight fantasy
Someone to share my
Wildest dreams with me
Imaginary lover you're mine anytime
Imaginary lovers, oh yeah
When ordinary lovers
Don't feel what you feel
And real-life situations lose their thrill
Imagination's unreal
Imaginary lover, imaginary lover
You're mine anytime
Imaginary lovers never disagree
They always care
They're always there when
You need satisfaction guaranteed
Imaginary lover, imaginary lover
You're mine all the time
My imaginary lover
You're mine anytime"
On Broadway,"They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
They say I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this guitar
And I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
No, no, no, no
I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
Do do do do..."
Come Sail Away,"I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the virgin sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board, I'm the captain
So climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow
On every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try
To carry on
I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can
To carry on
A gathering of angels
Appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope
And this is what they said, they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, baby
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels
But to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship
We headed for the skies, singing
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away"
This Time I'm In It For Love,"I heard the weatherman
Predict a sunny day
He did not mean to lie
I look outside it's raining anyway
I guess I can live with a rainy day
Cause in the scheme of things
You're bound lose a few
Even your best-made plans
Before you know it, they are falling through
But that couldn't happen to me oooh and you
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
My Ma she used to say
Beware the tender trap
If you get caught in one
Be sure you notice where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things
Things like that, oh, oh
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love
Baby, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
Crazy, baby
But how could I possibly lose
Ain't no way I could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love"
You Belong to Me,"Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me
You're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me
You belong to me
Can it be, honey
You're not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
Locked the door
You don't have to prove to me
That you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell
I can tell darling
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Baby, I really love you
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her
Tell her she don't know you
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Cause you belong to me"
Blue Bayou,"I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles, saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou
Saving nickles saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou"
Peg,"I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it, Peg
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better
Peg
It will come back to you
Peg
It will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie
I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better
Peg
It will come back to you
Peg
It will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie

You see it all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie

You see it all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie
Peg
It will come back to you
Peg
It will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3D
It's your favorite foreign movie"
You Needed Me,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me ""friend""
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me"
Reminiscing - Remastered,"Friday night, it was late, I was walking you home
We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
How to tell you girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I want to make you understand I'm talkin' about a lifetime plan
That's the way it began, we were hand in hand
Glenn Miller's Band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tunes (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
And on the way back home I promised you'd never be alone
Hurry, don't be late, I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night, it was late, I was walking you home
We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing
Hurry, don't be late, I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing"
Count on Me,"Precious love, I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep
In the eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost
In the air of a love so real
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through
Emerald eyes and China perfume
Caught on the wheel and lost
In the feel of a love so soon
Ruby lips, you make my song
Into the night and saved by
The light of a love so strong
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through
Woo hoo hoo hoo
You can count on me, girl
(Count on me)
You can count on my love
(Count on my love)
Precious love, I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep
In the eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost
In the air of a love so real
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love"

Hold on!"
Summer Nights - From “Grease”,"Summer lovin', had me a blast
Summer lovin', happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days drifting away
To uh, oh those summer nights
Oh well, oh well, oh well oh, uh
Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car?
She swam by me, she got a cramp
He ran by me, got my suit damp
I saved her life, she nearly drowned
He showed off splashing around
Summer sun, something's begun
But uh, oh those summer nights
Oh well, oh well, oh well oh, uh
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?
Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out till ten o'clock
Summer fling don't mean a thing
But uh, oh those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag
He got friendly holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet, just turned eighteen
Well, she was good, you know what I mean
Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But uh, oh those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?
It turned colder, that's where it ends
So I told her we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doin' now
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
But, oh, those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more"
What's Your Name,"Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho

Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,"I don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes

Because the Night,"Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight there are two lovers"
Every Kinda People,"Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man up on his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life
There's no profit in deceit
Honest men know that
Revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black, or white
Each and every man's the same inside
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
D-doo, doo, doo, doo, dum, dum, dum, ooh-ooh
You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul, ooh
Hey, and every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Mmm, every kinda people
To make what life's about"
Copacabana (At the Copa),"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor, they worked from eight til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?
At the copa (co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the copa (co) Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa they fell in love
Copa, Copacabana
His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit to far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?
At the copa (co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the copa (co) Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa, she lost her love
(Copa, Copacabana)
(Copa, Copacabana)
(Copacabana)
like in Havana
(Copa, banana)
Music and passion were always in fashion
Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind
At the copa (co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the copa (co) Copacabana
Music and passion were always in fashion
At the copa don't fall in love
don't fall in love

Sentimental Lady,"You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Bluer Than Blue,"After you go, I can catch up on my reading
After you go, I'll have a lot more time for sleeping
And when you're gone, looks like things are gonna be a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad
But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad
But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
I don't have to miss no TV show
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder
And I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
And life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue"
Running on Empty,"Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
'65, I was 17 and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on
Running on (running on empty)
Running on (running blind)
Running on (running into the sun)
But I'm running behind
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it, with what you do to survive
'69, I was 21 and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on
Running on (running on empty)
Running on (running blind)
Running on (running into the sun)
But I'm running behind
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone, but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes, I see them running too
Running on (running on empty)
Running on (running blind)
Running on (running into the sun)
But I'm running behind
Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around, but I'm running behind
(Running on) You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind) Running into the sun, but I'm running behind
Thank you"
Life's Been Good,"I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all
They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far
My Maserati does one-eighty-five
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked
I'm makin' records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody say, ""I'm cool, "" ""He's cool"")
I can't complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far
I go to parties sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, I haven't changed
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
(Everybody say, ""Oh yeah, "" ""Oh yeah"")
I keep on goin' guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Ah, yeah, yeah"
It's so Easy,"It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Here I go, breaking all the rules
It seems so easy (it's so easy, it's so easy)

Don't Look Back,"Don't look back, ooh, a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind, ooh, where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
Oh, yes, I will
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
It's a bright horizon, ooh, and I'm awaken
I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin', ooh, the clouds are breakin'
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong
Oh, yes I can
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Ooh, far away, I'm left behind, left behind
Oh, the sun is shining
And I'm on that road
Don't look back, ooh, a new day is breakin'
It's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind, ooh, where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around
Oh, yes I will

Ebony Eyes,"Well, have you seen that girl in the corner?
I'd like to take her out of her chains
'Cause if I have my way with you, baby
I would be changin' your life today
Your eyes got me dreamin'
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin'
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreamin'
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin'
That I'll be holding you close tonight
She was the same as a hundred ladies
But when my eyes looked at her, I learned
That she was keepin' a secret fire
And if I got real close, I'd burn
So, it looked like I had to move slowly
Like a cat at night in the trees
'Cause I was waiting for her to show me
The way that she liked her love to feel
Your eyes got me dreamin'
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin'
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreamin'
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin'
That I'll be holding you close tonight

Deacon Blues,"This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line
Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues)
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love with those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home
Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues)
This is the night of the expanding man
I take one last drag as I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be
I'll learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?,"Sugar, sugar
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby
He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby now we're all alone
They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He says I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar, we can watch the early movie
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
If you really want me

Sad Eyes - Remastered,"Looks like It's over, you knew I couldn't stay
She's comin' home today
We had a good thing, I'll miss your sweet love
Why must you look at me that way?
It's over
Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say ""goodbye""

Don't Cry Out Loud,"Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about 'er 'cause, you see
Baby is an awful lot like me
Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all
Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
The different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothin' left but sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher-that was me-I told 'er
Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all
Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost made it
Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all"
The Logical Song - Remastered 2010,"When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh, responsible, practical
Then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical
There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am
I said, now, watch what you say, they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
Oh, won't you sign up your name? We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable
Oh, take, take, take it, yeah
But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please (oh, won't you tell me)
Please tell me what we've learned?
(Can you hear me?) I know it sounds absurd
(Oh, won't you tell me) please tell me who I am
Who I am, who I am, who I am
Ooh
Hey
'Cause I was feeling so logical
Yeah
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Digital
Yeah, one, two, three, five
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, it's getting unbelievable
Yeah
Getting, getting, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, uh"
Just When I Needed You Most,"You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window and I
Struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now, I miss you more than I
Missed you before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Now, most every morning, I
Stare out the window and I
Think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more than I
Needed before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
(You left me just when I needed you most)
You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window and I
Struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now, I love you more than I
Loved you before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Oh yeah, you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most"
I'll Never Love This Way Again,"You looked inside my fantasies and made each one come true
Something no one else, had ever found, a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one, since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holdin' on, before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on
A fool will lose tomorrow reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow if you should go away
I'll stand here and remember just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holdin' on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holdin' on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Love You Inside Out,"Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh, what you're tryna do?
Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right
I ain't no vision, I'm the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I'm the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm crying for
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you 'til I die
I ain't no vision, I'm the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?"

The Gambler,"On a warm summer's evening
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us
And he began to speak
He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep""
And when he'd finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em (when to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (when to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done"
Lotta Love,"It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make this work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
You know I need relating not solitude
Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
It's gonna take a lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love"
Lady - 2010 Digital Remaster,"Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time
Make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter
But don't have a cold heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
A long time ago
I had a lady to love
She made me think of things
I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song
It was there all the time
So lady
Let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor
Making me want you somehow
Oh lady
I think it's only fair
I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you
'Cause maybe I do
Look around, come to me
I have no answers
But know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter
And cooled by a warm heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
So lady
Let me take a look at you now

I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know

She Believes In Me,"While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I come to her and say
""It was all right, "" and I hold her tight
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
Find a way
While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end while she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way
While she waits
While she waits
For me"

Sultans of Swing,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's a raining in the park but meantime-
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south
London town
You check out guitar George, he knows-all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Savin' it up, for Friday night
With the Sultans
We're the Sultans of Swing
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
""We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing"""
Lonesome Loser - Remastered 2010,"Have you heard about the lonesome loser?

A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there's no easy way around it
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer
Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads and walk on by
Tell me, is it worth just another try?
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer (you know the answer is love)
Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers
And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
When you're all alone, love one another
When you're far from home, love one another
When you're down and out, love one another
All your hope's run out, love one another
When you need a friend, love one another
When you're near the end, love
We got to love, we got to love one another
Light of the world, you got to shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all (know that love can save the day)
Set us free
Love is the answer
(Just give it, just one more chance)
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer (love, love, love)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer
(Lord, you just can't let it stop, Lord)
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free"
Shine a Little Love,"Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see I gotta make you understand
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Remember, tonight we're gonna run 'till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it
We'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on
I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you darlin' every day I need you more
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Can you understand (yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
It's been a year now and it's getting so much better
You came home without a word
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her
They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
Can you understand (yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
How many days had I been waiting there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight
We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see"
I Just Fall In Love Again,"Dreamin', I must be dreamin'
Or am I really lying here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is comin' true
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you when the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes.
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you"
I Just Wanna Stop,"When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Oooo, I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you, babe
I just gotta stop
For your love...
Oooo...
For your love
(For your lo... ve)
When I think about the way the world must turn
(The world must turn)
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me
(You and me)
Memories of life from times go on and on
Oooo, I try hard to forget it
But alone my mind won't let it
I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just gotta stop
For your love

Time Passages,"It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All round the day was going down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play
Well the picture is changing
Now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you
You once used to know
You reach out your hand
But you're all alone, in these
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight"
Don't Bring Me Down,"You got me runnin', goin' out of my mind
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time

How Much I Feel,"But I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue

I will be gone..., yeah...
Feel for you, baby

Of the togetherness
That seems to be leavin' me

All will be forgiven..., yeah...

Try to stay in the middle (try)
And then you cry, (cry)
Well you cry just a little (cry)
Then you both realize
Just how foolish you've been, oooo

And you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends
'Cause that's how much, that's how much
That's how much, that's how much
Oooo
How's your life been goin' on
I've got a wife now
Years we've been goin' strong
Oh no

There's just something that I've got to say
(Aaah...)
Sometimes when we make love
I still see your face
Oooo
Just try to recall when we were as one
(Aaah...)
That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby
How much I need I need your touch
How much I live, I live for your loving
That's how much"

On a sizzling summer day

Away...
For the magic of a sunrise
Only none of them will do
For you...
You take my breath away
And I don't know what to say
Cause you take my breath away.

How You Gonna See Me Now,"Dear darlin' surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
Just to let you know
I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view
How you gonna see me now
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
Listen darlin' now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes I'm worried honey
Guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow
How you gonna see me now
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
And just like the first time
We're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place I've been
And just like the first time
I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door
There'll be no place to hide
How you gonna see me now
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home"
Double Vision,"Feeling down n' dirty, feeling kinda mean
I've been from one to another extreme
This time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait
I want to stick around till I can't see straight
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision gets the best of me
Never do more than I really need
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit
I live all of my years in a single minute
Fill my eyes with that double vision, no disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah
Ooh, double vision, I need my double vision
It takes me out of my head, takin' me out of my head
I get my double vision, oh, seeing double double
Oh, I have double vision, (oh double vision) yeah
Oh I'm getting double vision"

Doctor Doctor, gimme the news
I got a bad case of lovin' you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I got a bad case of lovin' you"

Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got

The things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name

Friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter

Strange Way,"Didn't I hear you cry this mornin
didn't I feel you weep
Teardrops falling down on me
Like rivers in my sleep
In my dream of laughter
You came creeping with your tears
Telling me your sorrow
In the trace ends of your tears
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me
No don't cry to me
Didn't I hear your voice this morning
Didn't you call my name
I heard you whisper softly
But the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness
I came shinin like a sun
Waiting for the laughter
But the last I never caught
(Repeat Chorus)
Didn't you feel alone this mornin
didn't you need a friend
And in your darkest hour
You came runnin back again
In my dream of laughter
You came creeping with your tears
Telling me your sorrow
In the trace end of your tears
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me
No don't cry to me

It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,"What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise a miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
You best bet's a true baby blue Continental""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that their out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
""If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money""
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me"
Escape (The Pina Colada Song),"I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleepin'
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like makin' love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kinda mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Oh, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""
""That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape""
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's"
Lost In Love,"I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me
You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (carry on)
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
So lift your eyes if you feel you can (feel you can)
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan (show you a plan)

Ride Like the Wind,"It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
And I've got such a long way to go (such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind
And I've got such a long way to go (such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
Gonna ride like the wind
Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old
It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
And I've got such a long way to go (such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind

And I'll be missing you
Babe, I love you."
Still,"Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now
So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
We lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love you
Still!
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love you
Still!"
Sexy Eyes,"I was sitting all alone
Watching people get it on with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor

They were lovers

I looked up what did I see

Moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Getting down on you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell
And we knew it
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be

Sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see, believe me
It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see, believe me
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see, really, believe me
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free"
Coward Of The County,"Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him Yellow
But something always told me, they were reading Tommy wrong
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""
There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky an' there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
""Promise me, Son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the bar room
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Old Yellow's leaving""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"", as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say
""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man""
Everyone considered him the coward of the county"

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring

I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh so right?
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

Cool Change - Remastered 2010,"If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water
There's lots of you friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
And I never want to lose their inspiration
Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change
Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers
It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover
Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change
Well I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water
It's kind of a special feeling
When out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover
Time for a cool change
Time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well I know, I know, I know it's time for a cool, cool change"

Oh, our good times start and end
Without all I want to spend
But how much baby do we really need
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen"

Misunderstanding,"There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late
Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places you always go
I rang your home but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake."
An American Dream,"I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say?
My mind was drifting off on martinique bay
It's not that I'm not interested, you see
Augusta, georgia is just no place to be
I think jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to coconut grove
Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
I think jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to coconut grove
Voila! an american dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream jamaica is a big neon sign
Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain falling down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
Voila! an american dream
Yeah, we can travel, girl, without any means

You May Be Right,"Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said, ""I'm sorry""
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
Well, remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, ""Take me as I am""
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but It just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Oh, don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right

Should've Never Let You Go,"When you walk into a room
You're beauty steals my breath away
When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say
Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should've never let you go
Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share
But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear
I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so
Why did I have to write this song
I should've never let you go
Why in all the wide wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Why I even give a damn
When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground
I built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down
You're the kind I can't forget
Let the tears begin to flow
I have only one regret
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go"

It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay
And let me make it up to you?

Why should you care if you're feelin' good?

Oh, calamity, is there no way out?

Oh, it has to be, for you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you would have more time
So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?

September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before
September morn
Do you remember
How we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morning
Still can make me feel that way"
Give Me the Night,"Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers
'Cause I see that starlight
Look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly
Just gimme the night
Gimme the night
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers
'Cause I see that starlight
Look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly
And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
So, gimme the night
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
So, gimme the night
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night

Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
So, gimme the night"
Broken Hearted Me,"Every now and then I cry
Every night you keep stayin' on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song
I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken-hearted me
Every day is just the same
Playin' games, different lovers, different names
They keep sayin' I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song
I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken-hearted me
Time won't heal a broken-hearted me"
You Decorated My Life,"All my life was a paper
Once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life"
Tusk - 2015 Remaster,"Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne?
Don't say that you love me
Just tell me that you want me

Just say that you want me
Don't tell me that you

Breakdown Dead Ahead,"I call ya...
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where've you been
Ooh, baby, let it on the line
This is last call, you say that's all
You can take it fine
I'm sorry but...
It don't make sense
You're pullin' just right out on first offense
Ooh, baby, play it smart
For you go south with your big mouth
Let it take your heart...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down...
I told ya
No more lyin'
No more tears fallin'
Stop your cryin'
Ooh, baby, I'm your fan
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand...
Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
Just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Then just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down, down, down, down...
No, no, no..."
Ships,"We walked to the sea, just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say, ""Hold my hand""
I said, ""Love's easier when it's far away""
We sat and watched a distant light
We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say, ""It's alright""
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, ""It's harder now we're far away""
We only read you when you write
We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
We're just two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight"
Refugee,"We did somethin' we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it
Listen it don't really matter to me baby
You believe what you want to believe
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)
Somewhere, somehow somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you want to lay there
Revel in your abandon
Honey, it don't make no difference to me baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)
Now baby you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee) No
Baby we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lover's been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You gotta feel to be true
Somewhere, somehow somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away and held for ransom, honey
It don't really matter to me baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free
You see you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)
No you don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)
You don't have to live like a refugee (don't have to live like a refugee)

Bette Davis Eyes,"Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips a sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on a throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs, she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you
She'll unease you
Just to please you
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you
When she snows you
'Cause she knows you, she's got Bette Davis Eyes
She'll tease you"
Lady,"Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am, and
I am yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more
You have gone and made me such a fool
And I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?
Lady
For so many years
I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and
Made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly
In my ear
And in my eyes (In my eyes)
I see no one else but you (I see no one else but you)
There's no other love like our love
And, oh, girl I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Lady
Your love's the only love I need
Oh, and beside me is where
I want you to be (I want you to be)
'Cause, my love
There's somethin' I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady
Thank you Kenny"
(Just Like) Starting Over - Remastered 2010,"Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away
Somewhere alone
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over
Startin' over
Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over, Look out
Our life together
Is so precious together
We have grown, mmh we have grown
Although our love still is special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere
Starting over (over and over and over)"
Jessie's Girl,"Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body, I just know it
Yeah, and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
You know, I wish that I had
Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
I'll play along with the charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
You know, I wish that I had
Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman-
Where can I find a woman like that?
And I'm looking in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?
You know, I wish that I had
Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl"
Keep on Loving You,"You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead, but you never bled
Instead you laid still in the grass, all coiled up and hissin'
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us
Baby, way before then, and we're still together
And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you
And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you
Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you"
"Believe It or Not (Theme from ""Greatest American Hero"")","Look at what's happened to me
I can't believe it myself
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world
It should have been somebody else
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me
Just like the light of a new day
It hit me from out of the blue
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me
This is too good to be true
Look at me falling for you
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me

Morning Train (Nine to Five) - Edit,"I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly
'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off
My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright
My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
All day I think of him
Dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him
And he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night
My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him"
Queen Of Hearts,"Midnight, and I'm a-waitin' on the twelve-oh-five
Hopin' it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breakin'
If it's only for a very short time?
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody tellin' everybody what you have done?
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handin' out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
And knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime

Rapture,"Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movement
And a wild attack
Face to face
Sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, ""My my""
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars, get up"

I Love You,"When I was younger, man
I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair
You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life
Ooh, babe, you got what it takes
So I made you my wife
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, oooh, I love you
You came along
From far away
And found me here
I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile
You said, you're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile
And as my head was spinning around
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh, I want you
Thank you, babe, for being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, oooh, I need you
As my head was coming around
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh, I want you
Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, oooh, I need you
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
Oooh, I got you
If ever a man had it all
It would have to be me
And, oooh, I love you"

Angel Of The Morning,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
There's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears
Of the day
Of the years
Baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling"

Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want
Is a smile
First they say they want you
Hear how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
Maybe blue skies above
But it's cool
When your love's on the rocks
First they say they want you
Hear how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you

Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies
Yesterday is gone
And now all I want is a smile"
Every Woman in the World,"Overnight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturdays girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing my self to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me, oh
It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
'Til you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me, oh
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl
Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'm staying right here forever, oh
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality

The One That You Love,"Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say
Hold me in your arms
For just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh...
We have the right you know
We have the right you know
Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose
Love is everywhere
I know it is
Such moments as this
Are too few
Oh...
It's all up to you
It's all up to you
Here I am
The one that you love
Askin' for another day
Understand the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways
Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay oh please
They are the words to say
The only words I can believe
Hold me in your arms
For just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh...
We have the right you know
We have the right you know
Here I am
The one that you love
Askin' for another day
Understand the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways
The night has gone
A part of yesterday
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
Here I am
The one that you love
Askin' for another day
Understand the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways"
The Best Of Times,"Tonight's the night we'll make history
Honey, you and I
'Cause I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here tonight
I know you feel these are the worst of times
I do believe it's true
When people lock their doors and hide inside
Rumor has it it's the end of paradise
But I know, if the world just passed us by
Baby I know, you wouldn't have to cry, no no
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine
We'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find these are the best of times
These are the best of times
The headlines read ""These are the worst of times""
I do believe it's true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you'd always be around
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
When I'm alone with you (the best of times)
Everything's alright (are when I'm alone with you)
When I'm alone with you (some rain some shine)
You brighten up the night (we'll make this a world for two) said, when I'm alone"
Take It On the Run,"Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
They say you got a boyfriend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down
But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheaper when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is, keep this in mind
You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run
You're thinking up your white lies
You're putting on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home but you won't say when
But I can feel it coming
If you leave tonight, keep running
And you need never look back again
You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run
Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it

Living Inside Myself,"In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But suddenly, it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now, I can't go on
'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
I need a guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young
And time was on my side
Like a fool, I let it slip away
And now, those days are gone
I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh, how all the seasons change
And now, I'm not that strong
'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
(Somewhere inside my own dreams)
(Afraid of what life really means)
(Living without your love)
I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell"
Woman in Love,"Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know
We never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?
With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts
We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?
I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
You know, I know, how it feels?
What a woman can do
It's a right
I defend over and over again
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again"

Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion

Crying,"I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say ""Hello""
And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said ""so long"" left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do
For you don't love me and I'll always be
Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying, over you"
Hearts,"Is everything alright I just called to say
How lost I feel without you
Miles away I really can't believe I'm near
And how I still care about you
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Is everything the same do you ever think of me
And how we loved one another
Will you change your mind will you wander back
Again or have you found yourself a new love
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Is everything okay I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world how I miss you
Cause each and every day I think of all the words
I never said and all the chances that I had you
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be is everything alright"

Who's Crying Now,"It's been a mystery
But still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street

Love will survive somehow, somewhere
One love, feeds the fire
One heart, burns desire
I wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts, born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?
So many stormy nights
So many wrong or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They turn another page
The fighting is worth the love they save
One love, feeds the fire
One heart, burns desire
I wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts, born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?
Only so many tears you can cry
'Til the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die
Whoa ooh ooh, ooh ooh
One love, feeds the fire
One heart, burns desire
I wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts, born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?"

And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Hey
Oh take it - Bite the dust bite the dust
Hey Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust ow
Another one bites the dust he he
Another one bites the dust haaaa
Ooh shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out"

While You See A Chance,"Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you
Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day
Your way
Whoa, your way
When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
And that old grey wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And it's time you should be going
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because it's all on you
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance (fake it)
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance (oh, fake it, baby)
While you see a chance, take it
Find romance (oh)"
"Hello Again - From ""The Jazz Singer"" Soundtrack","Hello, again, hello
Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
I couldn't wait
Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home
Hello
Maybe it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all and you love me just the same
And when your not there
I just need to hear
Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And I feel this way when I hear you say

Don't Stand So Close To Me,"Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside him, there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staff room
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me"
Hey Nineteen,"Way back when in '67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?

No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along when you slide on down
Hey, nineteen

The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy
But I'm just growin' old

All Those Years Ago - Remastered 2004,"I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago
I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago"
The Stroke - Remastered,"Now everybody, have you heard, if you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm,
Don't take no style
Gotta thirst for killin',
Grab your vial uh
Put your right hand out, give a firm handshake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your ear pollution, both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and
Stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner boy you move mighty well
Stroke me, stroke me (stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but babe, you're just a sinner now
Put your left foot out, keep it all in place
Work your way right into my face
First you try to bet me, you make my backbone slide
When you find you've bled me, slip on by, and
Stroke me, stroke me
Give me the reason this is all night long
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
Get yourself together boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
(Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke)
Better listen now
Said it ain't no joke
Don't let your conscience fail ya'
Just do the stroke
Don't ya' take no chances
Keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances
You can't stop you just
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me

Treat Me Right,"You want me to leave,

You ask me to come back,

What Kind of Fool,"There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break, we let the heartache in
Who's sorry now?
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her, you let the stranger in
Who's sorry now, who's sorry now?
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart?
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now, wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow?
Forever more than what we are to be
Without each other
We'll be remembering when
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break, we let the heartache in
Who's sorry now, who's sorry now?
What, what kind of fool
(What kind of fool)
Tears it apart? (Tears it apart)
Leaving me pain and sorrow
(Oh, losin' you now, how can I win?)
(Where will I be tomorrow?)
Was there a moment when I cut you down? (No)
Played around, what have I done? I only apologise
For being as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes
What kind of fool
(What kind of fool)
Tears it apart?
(Tears it apart)
Leaving me pain and sorrow
(Losing you now)
(Wondering where)
(Where will I be tomorrow?)
Losing you now (losing you now)
How can I win? (How can I win?)
Where will I be tomorrow?
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break, we let the heartache in
Who's sorry now?

Watching The Wheels - Remastered 2010,"People say I'm crazy
Doing what I'm doing
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay, well they look at me kinda strange
""Surely, you're not happy now, you no longer play the game""
People say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me
When I tell them that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
""Don't you miss the big time boy, you're no longer on the ball?""
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
Ah, people asking questions
Lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well, they shake their heads and they look at me, as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry, I'm just sitting here doing time
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go

Tell It Like It Is,"If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy

Don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby I will, girl you know I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But ooh now deep down inside me, i believe you love me
Forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live
Tell it like it is
Have nothing to play with go find yourself a toy
But ooh, deep down deep inside me I belive you love me
Forget your foolish pride
If you are serious
Don't play, don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you then baby i will, you know i will
Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy anymore
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed let you conscience be your guide"
I Made It Through the Rain,"We dreamers have our ways
Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive
We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives
Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years
I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it thought the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through
When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid
Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade
'Cause when I chase my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say
I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it thought the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through
I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it thought the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through
And made it through
And made it through"

Centerfold,"Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom, homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain
Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much
My blood runs cold
Yeah, my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

Don't You Want Me,"You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up
And turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too.
Don't. Don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't. Don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good at times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
Don't. Don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me

Hard to Say I'm Sorry - 2009 Remaster,"Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go, ooh
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to

Harden My Heart,"Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain

Darlin' in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know, oh
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waiting for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close, but always disappears
Darlin', in your wildest dreams, you never had a clue
But it's time you got the news
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here
Darlin' in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go

Key Largo,"Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey, I was your hero
And you were my leading lady
We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Honey, can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will... play it again
'Cause I love you still
Baby, this can't be the end

Waiting for a Girl like You,"So long, I've been looking too hard
I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want to be sure
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your a love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word can say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, I really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up 'til deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be than holding you tenderly
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you, your a love that will survive

The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known),"When I see you in the morning
With that old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night
And as we lie here
Just two shadows
In the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing
I've ever known
Is lovin' you
And I have never been afraid of losin'
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing
I've ever known
Is lovin' you
Now you and I
We're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores
But all the heartaches and temptations
Only made me love you more
The sweetest thing
I've ever know
Is lovin' you
And I have never been afraid of losin'
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain

I've ever known

Sweet Dreams,"This is the time when you need a friend
You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night I'll spend
Thinking of you when you're not here
How many times will I think about the things I'd like to do?
Always denied the right to live my life the way I want
I want to share it with you
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
And what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait 'til I get home
There's not much time to tell you half the things I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me, I keep
For these moments alone
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes, I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Who Can It Be Now?,"Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend
Here they come, those feelings again!
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Is it the man come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?
It's not the future that I can see
It's just my fantasy, yeah
Ooh, who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Hold Me,"Can you understand me
Baby don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Oh, there's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
I don't want no damage
But how am I gonna manage with you
You hold the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues
I'm just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for ya'
If you ever want to be there
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

Leader of the Band,"An only child
Alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant
For different work
And his heart was known
To none --
He left his home
And went his lone
And solitary way
And he gave to me
A gift I know I never
Can repay
A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love
Through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand.
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through
My instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band.
My brothers' lives were
Different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well.
I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom
When it came my time to go --
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, pap, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough --
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through
My instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band
I am the living legacy
To the leader of the band."
Leather and Lace (with Don Henley),"Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow?
Shatter with words, impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile, I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me, I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Would you ever love a woman like me?
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong woman
Sometimes cold and scared and sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by
The first time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me, I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
Well, I need you to love me, I need you today
To give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace"
Even the Nights Are Better,"I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you"
'65 Love Affair,"I was a car hop
You were into be-bop
You sang do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
All of them changes you put me through
If I could go back again
Well I know I'd never let you go
Back with some of my friends
To that wonderful
'65 love affair
We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care
It was a crazy
'65 love affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear I can hear it baby
Well I asked you like a dumb-dumb
You were bad with your pom-poms
You said ooh wah go team ooh wah go
Ooh-ee baby I want you to know
If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful
'65 love affair
When rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby
Well, I tried to make you give in
One night at the drive-in
You said oh no baby, oh no woo
All of them changes you put me through
If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful
We sang doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
Doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo"
Heat Of The Moment,"I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face
Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
And now you find yourself in '82
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings
'Cause it's the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment, showed in your eyes
And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambitions you remember well
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
It was the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment"
Take It Easy On Me - Remastered 2010,"It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone, I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in the crowd
Hear me cryin' out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
So now I'll go the Minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in the crowd
Hear me cryin' out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
Oh baby don't leave me cryin'
It should be easy to see
I've needed you for so long
Just one more chance with you
One more chance will you, take a chance?
Come on and take a chance
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in the crowd
Hear me cryin' out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
It's still up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me"

Two, ah-three, ah-four!
Two, ah-three, ah-four!
I really should be saying goodnight.
I really shouldn't stay anymore.
It's been so long since I held ya.
I've forgotten what love is for.

Young Turks - 2008 Remaster,"Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams
He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this
Patti packed her bags, left a note for her mama, she was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye
They held each other tight as they drove on through the night, they were so excited
We got but one shot at life, let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down, don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view
Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a two room apartment that was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each other's arms as expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down, don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view
Come on Billy
Woo
Young heart, be free tonight
Time is on, on your side
Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody listening, so we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy, yeah
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time in on your side
Young hearts gotta run free, be free, live free

Freeze-Frame,"Freeze-frame
I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound
Thursday morning was a hot flash-factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip, proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame, now freeze
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feelings just won't disappear
Close-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame, now freeze
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)

Cool Night,"I sometimes wonder why
All the flowers have to die
I dream about you
And now, Summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight
Come on over
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh, when the cool night brings back memories
Of a good life when this love was not so old
Oh, I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you, don't have to take a stand
Lay out any plans
Come on over tonight
Come on over"
Caught Up In You,"I never knew there'd come a day
When I'd be sayin' to you
""Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true""
Don't, don't you know the kind of man I am
No, said I'd never fall in love again
But it's real and the feeling comes shining through
So caught up in you, little girl
And I never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never want to get myself free
And baby it's true
You're the one
Who caught me baby you taught me
How good it could be
It took so long to change my mind
I thought that love was a game
I played around enough to find
No two are ever the same
You made me realized the love I missed
So hot! Love I couldn't quite resist
When it's right the light just comes shining through
So caught up in you, little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never want to get myself free
And baby it's true
You're the one
Who caught me, baby you taught me
How good it could be
Fill your days and your nights
No need to ever ask me twice, oh no
Whenever you want me
And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away, oh no
I can't live without you
So caught up in you
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away, oh no
I can't live without you

Wasted on the Way - 2005 Remaster,"Look around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way
It used to be
I am older now
I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started
Long before I did
And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Oh when you were young
Did you question all the answers
Did you envy all the dancers
Who had all the nerve
Look round you know
You must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved
And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
And there's so much love to make up
Everywhere you turn
Love we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Let the water come and carry us away"
Think I'm In Love,"Ooh, somethin's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a lover on fire
Hold me tight, baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
It surrounds me
Over me like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
You're on my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

There must be somethin' to it

Personally,"I've been writing letters every day now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you by telephone
For what seems like a whole life long
But I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
The thing that I'm speaking of
Is a whole lot of love
A whole mess of love
I'm bringing it to you personally
I'm bringing it to you personally
I need your love, I want your love
I need your love, I want your love
I'm bring it to you personally"
One Hundred Ways,"Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play
Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer all night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways
Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say?
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways
Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your only chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance
Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way
In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways
In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways
You better believe it or love her today
Find one hundred ways
I'm telling you to love her today
Find one hundred ways
Oh, love her, love her, lover her
One hundred ways
Yeah, you've got to love her today
Find one hundred ways"
Our Lips Are Sealed - Single Version,"Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
Can you see them?

That we must use
In our defense

You Can Do Magic,"I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how can it be
No, no magic could happen to me

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know

When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
And when the night it gets so cold, when I can't sleep
Again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it
With a word you dry my tears
You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know
You're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
And If I wanted to
I could never be free
I never believed it was true
But now it's so clear to me
You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire

How do you know when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it''s real
You don''t need a sign to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel
You want to start sharin'', carin''
Carin'' again
Well, it''s your mind, that tricks you in believin'' every time
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well, it''s your heart, that talks you into to stayin'' where you are
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Turn you around"
Don't Stop Believin',"Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin', somewhere in the night
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some'll win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Whoa, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin', somewhere in the night
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people"
Comin' In and out of Your Life,"I still can remember
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end
I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me
And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends
Tried to let you go
But I can't, you know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me
Comin' in and out of your life isn't easy
When there's so many nights
I can't hold you, and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'Cause I don't need to touch you to feel you
It's real with you
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning up-side-down
You'll always belong to me
isn't easy
When there's so many times
I can't hold you, and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
I don't need to touch you to feel you
It's so real with you
I can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember"

Running after somebody, you gotta get him somehow

Will you meet him on the main line, or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money, take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away, don't believe it's comin' back soon
And you really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart, it's not mending

I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Man On Your Mind - 2002 Digital Remaster / 24 Bit Mastering,"Little River Band
I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch, day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea
I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner to a Chinese Junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk
I used to dream it could last forever
But pipedreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you
I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
You don't know just what you got till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot but it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name
It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know
I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
It's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night
Ooh I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
Baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye"
What's Forever For?,"I've been lookin' at people

And lately all I've been seein' are people
Throwin' love away and losing their minds
Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
But I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurtin' each other
When love is so hard to come by
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?
I've been listenin' to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe
I see love-hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even tryin' to keep it alive
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever

When I didn't care for anyone but you
And I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
Through the years, you've never let me down
You turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I stayed right here with you
Through the years
I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
Through the years, it seems to me I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad to be with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belong right here with you
Through the years, I've never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what life's about by loving you
Through the years
Through the years, you've never let me down

He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him

Left standing in the hall, yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing, ""Come away""

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing

Hungry Like the Wolf - 2009 Remaster,"Darken the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is a afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
A scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found

Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run

Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

For fear tonight is all

That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part
I found a picture of you, oh-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, oh-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart

Time won't give me time

Like they've got something real
But you and me
We know we've got
Nothin' but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time

You Can't Hurry Love - 2016 Remaster,"I need love, love
Ooh to ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine
My mama said, ""you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""love don't come easy
Well it's a game of give and take""
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes
How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said, ""you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take""
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I've grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hanging on
I remember mama said, ""you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""love don't come easy
Well it's a game of give and take""
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes
Now break
Now love, love it don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting
Ooh, 'til that day
But it ain't easy (love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy
My mama said you can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

Tell Her About It,"Listen boy
I don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away
You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe
'Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone
Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait, you got to
Tell her about it"

One in a million girl
(Why would I lie)
Now why would I lie
But don't fall in love
'Cause if you do
You find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girl)
She's one in a million girl
(Why would I lie)
Why would I lie
But don't fall in love
She's one in a million girl"
Solitaire,"I still remember, how much I used to need you
Tried so hard to please you, but you didn't need me
You knew I loved, you knew I always would be there
You just did what you wanted, you didn't care
All the cards were held by you
There was nothin' I could do
All those nights I sat alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' were you ever comin' home
Solitaire, it got so lonely
Solitaire, no one to hold me
Where were you when I played solitaire
It took some time, but I stopped thinkin' about you
Started livin' without you, now look who's back here
You've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait, no, no
You found out you loved me, just a little too late
Once the cards were held by you
Now there's nothin' you can do
All those nights you sit alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' if I'm ever comin' home
Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now
Solitaire, see how it feels to care
Solitaire, it gets so lonely
Solitaire, you wanna hold me
Don't wait up, on me, I won't be there
Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire
Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now
Solitaire, see how it feels to care
Solitaire, it gets so lonely
Solitaire, you wanna hold me
Don't wait up, 'cos babe, I won't be there

Don't Let It End,"What can I do
Pictures of you still make me cry
Trying to live without your love
It's so hard to do
Some nights I'll wake up
I'll look at your pillow
Hoping that I'll see you there
But I get up each day, not much to say
I've nowhere to go
Loneliness fills me up inside
'Cause I'm missing you
So if you'll give us a chance to remember
The love we had once together
Wait and see, time is all that we really need
I'm praying you won't say no
I mean to tell you
Don't let it end
Baby we could have so much more
Don't let it end
Honey please don't walk out that door
I'm telling you baby, I made my mistakes
But I'll make you this promise to do what it takes
I'll be there to protect you and hold you tight
You got my lovin' baby every single night
Don't let it end
I'm begging you, don't let it end this way
Don't let it end
I'm begging you, don't let it end this way
Don't let it end
Baby we could have so much more
Don't let it end
Honey please don't walk out that door
Don't let it end
I'm begging you don't let it end this way
Don't let it end
I'm begging you don't let it end this way, no, no, no
No, no, no
What will I do
If you say we're through
I need you to stay, honey
Don't let it end this way"
How Am I Supposed to Live without You,"I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leaving
Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see its true
So tell me all about it
Tell about the plans you're making
Then tell me one thing more before I go
Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone
Didn't come here for crying
Didn't come here to break down
It's just the dream of mine is coming to an end
How can I blame you
When I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends
I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
I need you now
It's more than I can take
Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone
I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
Now that you're dream has come true
Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone"
China Girl - 2018 Remaster,"Oh, little China girl
Oh, little China girl
I couldn't escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart is beating, loud as thunder
I saw these stars crashing down
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town
Just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth""
She says, ""Ssh""
She says ""Ssh""
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth""
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth""
She says, ""Ssh""

Oh, little China girl

Come Dancing,"They put a parking lot on a piece of land
When the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local pally
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday
Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing, it's only natural
Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she's always make him wait
In the hallway, in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek
Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did
My sister should have come in a midnight
And my mom would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late
Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate
The day they knocked down the pally
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the pally
Part of my childhood died, just died
Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the pally used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would
Come dancing
Come on sister, have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural
Come dancing
Just like the pally on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play"
"Promises, Promises - US Single Version","Never had a doubt in the beginning
Never a doubt
Trusted you true in the beginning
I loved you right through
Arm in arm we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did
You made me promises, promises
Knowing I'd believe
Promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Second time around, I'm still believing
The words that you said
You said you'd always be here
""In love forever"", still repeats in my head
You can't finish what you start
If this is love, it breaks my heart
You made me promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?
Arm in arm we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did
But you can't finish what you start

The Other Guy - 24-Bit Digitally Remastered 02,"I found out that you care for another guy
I found out that you want for another smile
We are alone as two different people can be
And it's hurting me so
Just to know that you don't care for me
The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again
I found out that your heart is with another guy
You found out that you're tellin' another lie
We've come apart and going our own separate ways
And you don't understand
Why I love you and want you to stay
The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again
You don't know it's me that you need
You're thinking of him and I can't compete
Well I'm here to say I still want you back again
The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all, you and I, we just need to try again
The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids

Making Love Out of Nothing at All,"I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I've gotta tell you
But I know I've gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun are
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at
Your eyes like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness at the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all"
Family Man,"She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose as she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide if he should hold his ground
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might, yeah""
She turned, tossed her head
Unlike her opening move, her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up, she was gone
Then he screamed, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And I don't think I want it tonight""
Then he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
Don't leave me alone 'cause I got to go home, please
""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And I don't think I want it tonight"""
All Right,"I know, know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try to find a reason why
You should pick it up, ooh, and try it again
'Cause it's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that, too late for me
I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time, this time things seem just a little different
And when I look in your eyes, you know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say it's
All right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that, too late for love
Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, the past behind us
Then we're on our way
Ooh, yeah
Time and time again I see, people so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find another reason why you should pick it up
Ooh, why you should kick it up, ooh, try it again
'Cause it's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, think we're gonna make it
Think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
Think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it

Straight From The Heart,"I could start dreamin' but it never ends

It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake

And all the boys have had their fun
No surface noise now, not much to say
They've got the bad guys on the run
Don't try to say you're sorry
Don't say he drew his gun
They've gone and grabbed old Ronnie
He's not the only one saying
It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake
Tell us commander, what do you think?
Cause we know that you love all that power
Is it on then, are we on the brink?
We wish you'd all throw in the towel
We'll not fade out too soon
Not in this finest hour
Whistle your favorite tune
We'll send a card and flower

It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake"

Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy,"I don't mind, when you act your age
It suits me fine, that you treat me like a child
And I can't deny, when I'm with you that you
Step outside, from all those fears locked up inside
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Takes me all the way
What I like, is what you've got to offer
Just my type, I don't mind playing on the edge
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Takes me all the way
Lead me to forbidden doors
You know I'm yours
Yeah you've got it, yeah I want it
Don't you know it babay
Right on time, a tight fit right on the money
So sublime, hot sweet cherries on the vine

Sleep alone tonight

Along the wire
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line, it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours

Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wonderin' where I am
Lost without you
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours

Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Forever yours

Steppin' Out,"Now, the mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes
We are tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive to the other side
Into the night, into the light
We are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the TV and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?
You can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while, if you follow
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night, into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night, into the light"
Take Me To Heart,"You won't forget my eyes
Oh deep inside you realize
You're gonna see me wherever you go
You're gonna hear me on your radio
There you are in your car
And suddenly
You hear me
""Do you want me? Do you want me?""
Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time
I'm always on your mind
I'm the chill that never left your spine
In the building where you live and breathe
I'm the sound that never lets you sleep
Down the hall through the walls
You hear a voice that's calling
""Do you want me? Do you want me?""
Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time
Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time"
Lawyers in Love,"I can't keep up with what's been going down
I think my heart must just be slowing down
Among the human beings, in their designer jeans
Am I the only one who hears the screams?
And the strangled crys of lawyers in love
God sends his spaceships to America, the beautiful
They land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful
Eating from TV trays, tuned into happy days
Waiting for world war three while Jesus slaves
To the mating calls of lawyers in love
Ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
Ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
(Ah-oh), ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
Ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
Last night I watched the news from Washington, the Capitol
The Russians escaped while we weren't watching them
Like Russians do
Now we've got all this bloom, we needn't got the room
And I hear the U.S.S.R will be open soon
As vacation land for lawyers in love
Lawyers in love
Ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
Ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
(Ah-oh), ooh-sha-la-la-ooh
Ooh, sha lala ooo ooh
Lawyers in love"
Photograph,"If you want it (oo-oo-oo)
You can have it (oo-oo-oo)
But you gotta learn to reach up there and grab it (oo-oo-oo)
'Cause everybody wants some love (oh baby)
Shoot it from the stars above (oh baby)
And though my heart would break
It's more than I can take
I can never get enough
If you need it (oo-oo-oo)
You should show it (oo-oo-oo)
'Cause at my place overnight suggest you grow it (oo-oo-oo)
'Cause everybody wants some hope (oh baby)
Something they can barely know (oh baby)
And though my heart would break
It's more than I could take
I can never let it go
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love
'Cause everybody wants a dream (oh baby)
Something they can barely see (oh baby)
And though my heart would break
It's more than I could take
I could never let it be
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love
If you blew it (oo-oo-oo)
Don't reject it (oo-oo-oo)
Just keep drawing up the plans and re-erect it (oo-oo-oo)
Just keep drawing up the plans and re-erect it (oo-oo-oo)
Just keep drawing up the plans and re-erect it (oo-oo-oo)"
True - Single Edit,"OiSo true funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin all night long
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of it's own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be known
I know this much is true
I know this much is true
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I've Got a Rock 'N' Roll Heart,"I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy, before we explode
There's something 'bout me, baby, you got to know, you got to know
I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin' me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't
Want to change, I don't want to change
I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good
Well I get off on '57 Chevys
Well I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart

It Might Be You,"Time, I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you
So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life
I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life
It's you, maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
(Maybe it's you) It's you (Maybe it's you) It's you
(I've been waiting for all of my life)

Breaking Us In Two,"Don't you feel like trying something new
Don't you feel like breaking out
Or breaking us in two
You don't do the things that I do
You want to do things I can't do
Always something breaking us in two
You and I could never live alone
But don't you feel like breaking out
Just one day on your own
Why does what I'm saying hurt you
I didn't say that we were through
Always something breaking us in two
They say two hearts should beat as one for us
We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that won't be too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice
It's oh so hard to do
Could we be much closer if we tried
We could stay at home and
Stare into each others eyes
Maybe we could last an hour
Maybe then we'd see right through
Always something breaking us in two
They say two hearts should beat as one for us
We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that won't be too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice
It's oh so hard to do
Could we be much closer if we tried
We could stay at home and
Stare into each others eyes
Maybe we could last an hour
Maybe then we'd see right through

What's Love Got to Do with It,"You must understand how the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Huh
I've been takin' on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinkin' about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Ho oh
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Got to do
Huh, got to do with it
(What's love but a second hand emotion?)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
What's love?
(Ooh, ooh)
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?
(But a second hand emotion?)
Got to do
Huh, got to do with it

Footloose,"Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
I gotten this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon, before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-wee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose
we got to turn you around
(Second) you put your feet on the ground
(Third) now take a hold of your soul
I'm turning it loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees

C'mon, before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
Footloose (footloose), footloose

Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now) - 2016 Remaster,"How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath, with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh, take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
Instrumental
I wish, I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you so many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, 'cos there's just an empty space
But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, 'cos I'll still be standin' here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take

Take a look at me now"

Hello,"I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much, I love you
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying, I love you

Owner of a Lonely Heart,"Move yourself
You always live your life

You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

Missing You,"Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And that's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
There's a message in the wild
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
'Cause I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
No way
Since you've been gone away (I can lie to myself these days)
I ain't missing you
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you (I can lie to myself these days)
I ain't missing you at all, I ain't missing you (No way, baby)
No matter what my friends say (I'm doing fine here)
And I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself every time I think of you
I'm okay
I'm doing fine here from day to day
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself"

Time After Time,"Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say, ""go slow""
And I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside)
And the drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
I've got a suitcase of memories that I almost left behind
Time after time
Time, time, time
But you say to go slow but I fall behind
Time after time after time (after time, oh)"
Talking In Your Sleep,"When you close your eyes and go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreaming about
When you open up your heart
And the truth comes out
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight
And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets
That you just can't hide
When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery"
Self Control,"Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes
A safe night (you take my self, you take my self control)
I'm living in the forest of my dream (you take my self, you take my self control)
I know the night is not as it would seem (you take my self, you take my self control)
I must believe in something
So I'll make myself believe it (you take my self, you take my self control)
This night will never go
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh...

Hold Me Now,"I have a picture
Pinned to my wall

All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears that we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa
Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start
You say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world we know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, and go far away
But you know that there's nowhere that I'd rather be than with you here today

Well, what could I say?
You know that I do and that this is just one of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry anymore
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Hold me now, whoa

Eyes Without A Face,"I'm so out of hope
One more bad break
And I might fall

To tell me you're alone

It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
They got no human grace
They're eyes without a face
I spent all my time
Believing all the lies
To keep my dreams alive
Yes, it makes me sad
It make you mad at truth
For loving what was your
eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
They got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket and then make a slip
You steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line, turning holy water into wine
Drink it, drink it down
Yeah, I'm on this bus on a psychedelic trip
I'm reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
And I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there
So say your prayers
Now I close my eyes
Yes, I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Love what was once
So alive and new
When it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realize
eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
They got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
Just some human waste
Your eyes without a face

And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

Twist of Fate,"Do we deserve a second chance?

Telling me to get it right this time

Love is what we've found the second time around
Don't understand what's going on
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone
This is a new beginning
I'm back in the land of the living
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing without the love you bring
Love is what we've found the second time around
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait

Hard Habit to Break - 2006 Remaster,"I guess I thought you'd be here forever

I'm still tryin' to shake it

Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Turning me on, turning me off,
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time
I could leave but I won't go
Well it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
Why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Truth is I love you
More than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no-one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'till the end
I could leave but I won't go
It'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
But I love you
More than I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no-one who
Makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'till the end
But just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all"
Running With The Night - Single Version,"The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(We were running)
Oh
(Running with the night)
You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us
We were burning
We were gonna go all the way
And we never had a doubt
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(We were running)
Oh-oh-oh-oh...
(Running with the night)
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got
We laid it down
Taking every shot
We took the town
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl it was so right... so right...
Oh (running with the night)
(Oooo-oooo...)
(Oooo-oooo...)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Just you and I
(Running with the night)
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
Girl it was so right
(We were running)
Girl was so right
(Running with the night)
(So right so right...)
So right"
I Want A New Drug,"I want a new drug, one that won't make me sick
One that won't make me crash my car
Or make me feel three-feet thick
I want a new drug, one that won't hurt my head
One that won't make my mouth too dry
Or make my eyes too red
One that won't make me nervous
Wonderin' what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I want a new drug, one that won't spill
One that don't cost too much
Or come in a pill
I want a new drug, one that won't go away
One that won't keep me up all night
One that won't make me sleep all day
One that won't make me nervous
Wonderin' what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
I'm alone with you, baby
I'm alone with you, baby
I want a new drug, one that does what it should
One that won't make me feel too bad
One that won't make me feel too good
I want a new drug, one with no doubt
One that won't make me talk to much
Or make my face breakout
One that won't make me nervous
Wonderin' what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, yeah, yeah"
Love Is A Battlefield,"We are young

Heartache to heartache
(We stand)
We stand
No promises
(No demands)
No demands
(Love is a battlefield)
Love is a battlefield
Whoa
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield
You're making me go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side
We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand
No promises
No demands
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield
When I'm losing control
Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old
Will it still feel the same
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer
I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold
We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand
No promises
No demands
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield"
Infatuation,"Early in the morning I can't sleep
I can't work and I can't eat
I've been drunk all day, can't concentrate
Maybe I'm making a big mistake
Caught me down like a killer shark
It's like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Heart beats silly like a big bass drum
Losing all equilibrium
It's so hard in the middle of the week
Maybe this woman's just all I need
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
'Fatuate me baby
Spirits soar when I'm by her side
She put a little love in this heart of mine
Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm freed
Maybe this woman's just all I need
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand

Legs - 2008 Remaster,"She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's holdin' leg, wonder how to feel them
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?
She's my baby, she's my baby
Yeah, it's alright, oh yeah
She's got hair down to her fanny
She's kinda jet set, try to undo her panties
Every time she's dancin', she knows what to do
Everybody wants to see if she can use it
She's so fine, she's all mine
Girl, you got it right
Oh
She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, knows how to choose them
She's got a dime all of the time
Stays out at night, movin' through time
Oh, I want her, said, I got to have her
Little girl is alright, she's alright, oh"
"Love Somebody - from ""Hard to Hold"" - Original Soundtrack","I can see the path you're cutting

When you're curious
I'll be back around
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

Flashdance... What A Feeling,"Well, what's this new feeling coming out of the streets
Everybody's talking ‘bout it wherever they meet
Down by the corner, I keep getting the heat
Then my feet start moving to the rhythmic beat
Breakdancing, break out
Breakdancing, break out
They used to do the locomotion, do the jerk and the twist
But there just ain't never been nothing like this
Now popping and locking is a new way of talking
Things will work out for sure spinning ‘out on the floor
Breakdancing, break out
Breakdancing, break out
Hearts are pumping, beat is thumping
Love the way you're looking tonight
Fever's rising, no surprises
We won't have the chance to fight
Breakdancing, break out
Breakdancing, break out"
Adult Education,"Adult, adult,
Adult
Education
Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slams on the plans you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know who could put you right
In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart
Believe it or not there's life after high school
And that's why
The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult
Education
Oh yeah
The teacher don't know about how to deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool
All your girlfriends care about the watch you wear and talkin' about it
Believe it or not there's life after high school
That's why
The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, is a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult
Education
Oh yeah
They're calling it a preparation
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember
So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you
The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember
The senior with the junior Miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education it's a bad situation

Nobody Told Me - Remastered 2010,"Three, four

There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot

Church Of The Poison Mind - Remastered 2002,"Desolate loving in your eyes

Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind

I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink in neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time?
Who am I to say that's crazy?
Love will make you blind

When you think of Laura laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
A friend of a friend
A friend till the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning
I know you and you're here

Are you far away from here

I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold turned into a shining band of gold
I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition
I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you'll find your servant is your master

You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger"

Head Over Heels,"… Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losin' it
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know looks sometimes deceive
… Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong
… Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
… Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I've waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart
… Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
… Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
… Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think

That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time"
Got a Hold on Me,"You're liftin' me up
Never let me down
And I smile
Whenever you're around
Ooh, and I've got a feelin'
In a work out right
Can't stop thinkin' about you
Every day and night
Ooh, I got a love, I got somebody
This love got a hold on me
Yeah, I got a love, I got somebody
This love got a hold on me
Well, I've been in love
And I've lost
I can count the tears
But I can't count the cost
Oh, I've been down
I've been used
Now I know, I know, I know
That I just can't lose
Ooh, I got a love, I got somebody
This love got a hold on me
Ooh, I got a love, I got somebody
This love got a hold on me
Yeah, I got a love, I got somebody
This love got a hold on me
Ooh, I got a love, I got somebody

Undercover (Of The Night) - Remastered 2009,"Hear the screams of center 42
Loud enough to bust your brains out
The oppositions tongue is cut in two
Keep off the street cause you're in danger
One hundred thousand disparus
Lost in the jails in south america
Cuddle up baby
Cuddle up tight
Cuddle up baby
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
The sex police are out there on the streets
Make sure the pass laws are not broken
The race militia has got itchy fingers
All the way from new york back to Africa
Cuddle up baby
Keep it all out of sight
Cuddle up baby
Sleep with all out of sight
Cuddle up baby
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Undercover
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
All the young men they've been rounded up
And sent to camps back in the jungle
And people whisper people double-talk
And once proud fathers act so humble
All the young girls they have got the blues
They're heading on back to center 42
Keep it undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Keep it undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
Down in the bars the girls are painted blue
Done up in lace, done up in rubber
The johns are jerky little g.i. joes
On r&r from cuba and russia
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide
All these things I can't keep inside
Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover

Undercover of the night"
New Moon on Monday - 2010 Remaster,"Shake up the picture the lizard mixture with your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers all of which I deny
I said it again but could I please rephrase it, maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer but I'll wait 'til you decide
Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
Breaking away with the best of both worlds a smile that you can't disguise
And every minute I keep finding clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night (fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite (I light my torch and wave it for the)
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night (fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day

Magic - 2017 Remaster,"Summer, it turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round
I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
The high shoes with the cleats a-clickin'
A temperamental glow
Oh, don't you let me go
Oh, got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you tonight
Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you (I got a hold on you)
That's right
When I'm with you
(Oh, it's magic)
(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic
You know it's true
I got a hold on you
Oh, twisted
Under, sideways, down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down
I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it?
'Til you realize
There's magic in your eyes
I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you)
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Uh oh, when I'm with you

When You Close Your Eyes,"What'ya do when it's falling apart
And you knew it was gone from the very start
Do you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
A girl in love with a gleam in your eye
I was a younger boy all dressed in white
We're older now
I'll bet you still think about me
I remember we learned about love in the back of a Chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young, it feels like yesterday
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
Do you still dream about me
I guess I don't know what I'm thinkin'
Come off a hard night of drinkin'
Angie come closer to me
I need a soul to bleed on
It could've been done in a different kinda way
But that ain't you, you play tough when you play
It's over now
I'll bet you still think about me
I remember when I held you so tight and we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide-eyed kids I need you so much today
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
I remember we learned about love in the back of a Chevrolet
No good for an old memory, to mean so much today
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you go to sleep at night, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream, dream about me
When you close your big brown eyes, do you dream about me"
Rock Me Tonite,"I'm rockin' tonite - I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble - gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite - I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree
You want it all right... we're goin' in style
Say you walk right - you talk right - and your hair's so wild
Snow-white - hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between
Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment - leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion - set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near
Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonight
You do it all right - you're passion to see
You been schooled in the art of romancin' me
Hold tight - you're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside
No one's stoppin' us now -
We go down, down where the music's loud
If it's all night - hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love - play it all for me
Life's never easy - we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances - face 'em side by side
Live for the moment - on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be
A time for all... and all in time
To slip beyond the border line
Of who we are and where we long to be...
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away
Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonight"
I Want to Know What Love Is - 1999 Remaster,"I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
This mountain, I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
Keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me (hey)
Gotta take a little time
Little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
Looks like love has finally found me
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is (I wanna know)
I want you to show me (I wanna feel)

Out of Touch,"Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
Time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch

Can't Fight This Feeling,"I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running 'round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm followin' you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for

The Power Of Love,"The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But do be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go 'round
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do (to do)
When it gets hold of you

St. Elmos Fire (Man in Motion),"Growin' up, you don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed
Play the game, you know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on, only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner and you're tryin' to break free
I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire (Ooh, oooh, oooh)
Burning up, don't know just how far that I can go
(Just how far I go)
Soon be home, only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know, I can
You broke the boy in me but you won't break the man
I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire
I can climb the highest mountain, cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me, burnin' in me
Just once in his life a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive
I can hear the music playin', I can see the banners fly
Feel like you're back again, and hope ridin' high
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire
I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire
I can climb the highest mountain, cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin', burnin' in me, I can feel it burnin'
St. Elmo's fire, St. Elmo's fire"

You Belong To The City,"The sun goes down the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room and down on the street
You can feel the crowds in the midnight heat
The traffic roars the sirens scream
Look at the faces it's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye you were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again and you're feeling strange
So much has happened but nothing has changed
Still don't know where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, it's in your moves
For a man of the streets
You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You're wanna make it
'Cause you can take it
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong
You belong"
One More Night - 2016 Remaster,"One more night, one more night
I've been trying, oh so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see
Please give me one more night
Give me one more night
One more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night
Ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
I've been sitting here so long, wasting time
Just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought, maybe you're not alone
Please give me one more night
Give me just one more night

And if you sail away
I will follow you
Give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
I can't wait forever
I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn
Give me just one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night

The Wild Boys,"Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys
The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory, reckless and so hungered
On the razor's edge you trail because there's murder
By the roadside in a sore afraid new world
They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
You got sirens for a welcome, there's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory, where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes"
We Belong,"Many times I tried to tell you
Many times I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Don't want to leave you really
I've invested too much time to give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit? Do we distort the facts?
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it, how much we really care
I hear your voice inside me, I see your face everywhere
Still you say
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder"
Nightshift,"Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing his song
His heart in every line
Marvin, sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Oh talk to me, so you can see, what's goin' on
Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore
Gonna be some sweet sounds
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right, on the nightshift

I know you're not alone, on the nightshift, ooh
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Jackie, hmm, hey what you doing now
It seems like yesterday, when we were working out
Jackie, oh, you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us
Your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up, and we'll be there at your side
Oh, say you will, sing your songs
For evermore, evermore, evermore
Gonna be some sweet sounds
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night (Gonna be a long night)
It's gonna be alright, on the nightshift

Things Can Only Get Better,"We're not scared to lose it all
Security throw through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands
Won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Treating today as though it was
The last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time
A lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Aw!"
Never Surrender,"Just a little more time is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty can bring you down
And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how
So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some
And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how
So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
No one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender
Oh, time is all we're asking for
To never surrender
Oh, oh, you can never surrender
The time is all you're asking for
Ooh, stand your ground, never surrender
Oh, I said
You never surrender, oh"

Strut,"He said, ""Baby, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you use your imagination
Nations go to war over women like you,
It's just a form of appreciation
Come on over here, lay your clothes on the chair
Now let the lace fall across your shoulder
Standing in the half light, you're almost like her
So take it slow like your daddy told you""
Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door
I said, ""Honey, I don't like this game,
You make me feel like a girl for hire
All this fascination with leather
And lace is just the smoke from another fire""
He said, ""Honey, don't stop a speeding train
Before it reaches its destination
Lie down here beside me, oh, have some fun too
Don't turn away from your true vocation""
Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door
I won't be your baby doll, be your baby doll
I won't be your baby doll, be your baby doll"
The Search Is Over,"How can I convince you
What you see is real?
Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel?
I was always reachin'
You were just a girl I knew
I took for granted
The friend I had in you
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while
Can we last forever?
Will we fall apart?
At times, it's so confusing
The questions of the heart
You followed me through changes
And patiently you'd wait
'Til I came to my senses
Through some miracle of fate
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while
Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie, victims of the game
Then good luck, it finally struck
Like lighting from the blue
Every highway's leading me back to you
Now at last, I hold you
Now all is said and done
The search has come full circle
Our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me
Show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain
The man I really am
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Then I touched your hand
I could hear you whisper
The search is over
Love was right before my eyes"

We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),"Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation (the last generation, generation)
We are the ones they left behind
And, I wonder when we are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear, 'til nothing else remains
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome
Looking for something, we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there

Better Be Good to Me - 2015 Remaster,"A prisoner of your love

Captured

Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
Should I, should I
Oh, you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
Cause I don't have no use

Be good, be good to me
Why can't you be good me"
Head Over Heels,"I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance via the system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out until I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away
Throw it away, throw it away
I made a fire, and watching it burn
Thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last?
Now, now, now, have you no ambitions?
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out until I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away
And this is my four leaf clover
I'm on the line, one open mind
This is my four leaf clover
In my mind's eye
One little boy, one little man
Funny how time flies"
Don't Lose My Number - 2016 Remaster,"They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
No nobody knew where to find him

No More Lonely Nights (Ballad) - Remastered 1993,"I can wait another day
Until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a-flutter
But another lonely night
Might take forever
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me, love
'Cause I know what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
Yes, I know
What I feel
To be right
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night, I'm always there
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights, no no"
I Can't Hold Back,"There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true
Can ya feel me tremble when we touch?
Can you feel the hand of fate?
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait
I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now
Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now

Summer Of '69,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah!
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no
Yeah
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah
Me and my baby in '69, oh, oh
It was the summer, summer, summer of '69

I'm On Fire,"Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go and leave you all alone? Mhmm
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do? Oh no
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
Through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

Lay Your Hands On Me (Album Version),"This old life seemed much too long
Little point in going on
I couldn't think of what to say
Words just vanished in a haze
I was feeling cold and tired
Yeah, kinda sad and uninspired
When it almost seemed too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic in your touch
Oh, lay your hands
Lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (woo hoo)
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands
Back and forth across the sea
I have chased so many dreams
But I have never felt the grace
That I have felt in your embrace
I was tired and I was cold
Yeah, with a hunger in my soul
When it almost seemed too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic of your touch
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Lay your hands, woo hoo
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands, oooh
You know you make me feel so good
Yeah, like I never ever thought I would
You know you make me feel so strong
And now our laughter just goes on and on (and on)
So c'mon lay your hands on me
'Cause close to you
Is where I really wanna be
And if it ever gets too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic in our touch
Oh, lay your hands
Lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (Woo hoo)

I guess they knew we'd work it out
In our own way

Can I put my arms around you?

Custom made for two lonely people like me and you
Radio playin' softly
Some singer's sad sad song
He's singin' about standin' in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

California Girls,"Well, east coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The midwest farmers' daughters
Really make you feel all right
And the northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
I dig them girls
I wish they all could be California (woo)
I wish they all could be California (wow)
I wish they all could be California girls
The west coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island coast
By a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world
And I've seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States
Back to the cutest girls in the world

Fortress Around Your Heart,"Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow lights
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns have been pounding through the nights
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the field's I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once laid
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire"

There ain't nothing ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you dancing out at Madame Wong's to
You did those same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Cafe
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun
With your sudden romance
Out on Sentimental Street in the avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothing ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Sugar Walls,"My sugar walls
My sugar walls
Where I came from there's a place called heaven
That's the place where all the good children go
The houses are of silver, the streets are gold
But there's more where you come from, my sugar walls
Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion when passion is hot
Temperatures rise inside my sugar walls
Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never want to fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls
Take advantage, it's alright
I feel so alive when I'm with you
Come and feel my presence, it's raining tonight
Heaven on earth inside my sugar walls
Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never want to fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls
I can tell you want me, (my sugar walls) it's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it, come inside (my sugar walls)
Ah (my sugar walls) oh
Come inside (my sugar walls), my sugar walls (my sugar walls)

"That's What Friends Are For (with Elton John, Gladys Knight & Stevie Wonder)","And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you

Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more

Well, you came in loving me

A voice was crying out

That's the way it should be
Say you, say me

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two

You've got someone there to say, ""I'll show you""

Kyrie eleison
Kyrie elei
The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road
My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gem-like flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again
Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison on a highway in the night
When I was young, I thought of growing old
Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be?
Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison where I'm going, will you follow?

There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry),"Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

"Take My Breath Away - Love Theme from ""Top Gun""","Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
My love, take my breath away
Through the hourglass, I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed, I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today, I am unafraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say
Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away"
You Give Love A Bad Name,"Shot through the heart

When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run

And you're to blame

These Dreams,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
Is it cloak 'n' dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

Something About You,"How how can it be that a love

That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you
Baby tonight
If ever our love was concealed

A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love, it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said
Was it my eye that let you know you had control
Because the way you moved was so self assured
You knew I would surrender

You found out I've got a crush on you

Throwing It All Away - 2007 Remaster,"Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions are something we don't share?
I don't want to be sitting here, trying to deceive you
Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
I've known it from the start
Everytime that I look at you, well, I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say to make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turning upside down
Throwing it all away
Now who will light up the darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers when you don't understand?
Why should I have to be the one who has to convince you?
'Cause you know I know baby that I don't wanna go
Someday you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you that our love was meant to be
But late at night when you call my name, the only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling, calling after me
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Ah-ha
We're throwing it all away
Yes we're throwing it all away
Yes we're throwing it all away"

That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away

I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time
Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you
I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes
I wonder where you are

You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight

I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you
Take you to the good times
See you through the bad times
Whatever it takes
Is what I'm gonna do
Let 'em say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
All that I want to do
Is hold you forever
Forever and ever...
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now (Nothing's gonna stop us)
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now"
Here I Go Again - 2018 Remaster,"I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
Here I go again, here I go again
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
Here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
And here I go again on my own
Going down the only road I've ever known

Livin' On A Prayer,"Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love, for love
She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay, someday
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Take my hand, we'll make it I swear

Don't Dream It's Over,"… There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're travelling with me
… Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
… Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion
But there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page
… Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win
… Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release
… Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know they won't win

"(I've Had) The Time of My Life - From ""Dirty Dancing"" Soundtrack","Now I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt like this before
Yes I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you
I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency
Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love, because
I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
Hey, baby
With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no
Yes, I know what's on your mind
When you say, ""Stay with me tonight"" (stay with me)
Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love, because
I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear (yes, I swear), it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

(I Just) Died In Your Arms,"Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
I keep lookin' for somethin' I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
Is there any just cause for feelin' like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away"
You Keep Me Hangin On,"Keep me hangin' on

Set me free why don't you, babe
Get out my life why don't you, babe (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Keep Your Hands to Yourself,"I got a little change in my pocket goin' jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wants to call you on the telephone baby, a-give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' ring
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
B-B-B-baby baby baby why you wan' treat me this way
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story, 'bout free milk and a cow
And said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' vow
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
Hold it here
See I wanted her real bad, and I was about to give in
But that's when she started talking about true love,
Started talking about sin
And I said, honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life,
She said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until you make me your wife-a
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
Land of Confusion - 2007 Remaster,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go 'round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
This is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth living in
Oh, Superman, where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go 'round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago
Oh, when the sun was shining
Yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go 'round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
Now this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
And these are the names we're given (oh, oh, oh)
Stand up and let's start showing (oh, oh, oh)
Just where our lives are going to"
Jacob's Ladder,"I met a fan dancer
Down in Southside Birmingham
She was running from a fat man
Selling salvation in his hand
Now he's trying to save me
When I'm doing all right
The best that I can
Just another fallen angel
Trying to get through the night
Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder
Coming over the airwaves
The man says I'm overdue
Sing along, send some money
Join the chosen few, hey
Mister, I'm not in a hurry
And I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today
Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today
Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing and climbing
Step by step, one by one
Step by step, rung by rung
Step by step
And step by step

In Too Deep - 2007 Remaster,"All that time I was searching
Nowhere to run to, it started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
And no one listening
All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why
Oh I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you
All this time
I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me
It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
You know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this

Hip To Be Square,"I used to be a renegade
I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment
And had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight
And yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy
But I don't even care
'Cause I can tell what's going on
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
I like my bands in business suits
I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day
And watchin' what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me
But I don't even care
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
It's not too hard to figure out
You see it every day
And those that were the farthest out
Have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway
It don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it
An idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
Tell 'em, boys
So hip to be square

Will You Still Love Me? - Alternate,"Take me as I am put your hand in mine now and forever
Darling here I stand, stand before you now deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me, two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me, every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on if I'm on my own
Take me as I am, put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
'Cause I am just a man who never understood, I never had a thing to prove
There was you you and me then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on if I'm on my own
Do you believe a love could run so stong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on without somebody I could call my own
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on
'Cause I can't go on, no, I can't go on"

Don't Mean Nothing,"Welcome to the big time.
You're bound to be a star
And even if you don't go all the way,
I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, Oh no
Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart
Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line
The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, ""I love your work, babe"" but
You're just not what we're looking for
It's never what but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow
Take a good look around and you'll find
People tryin' to mess with your mind
Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line
Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
But the party is never over
Cause stars are always shining
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
The producer says, ""let me change a line or two""
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you want to scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living,
There ain't no such thing as pride, no
Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart
Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line
It don't mean nothing at all"

Change of Heart,"Here I am
Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend

Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I'm here
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat to turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat, please, turn it around (turn it around)
Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars, we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat to turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat, please turn it around
Turn it around, 'round, around, yeah
Turn it around, 'round, around
Turn it, turn it, turn it around
Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
While I bide my time
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat to turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat, please, turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat to turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart

When Smokey Sings,"Ooh-ooh (Ooh ooh)
Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight
When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings
Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best?
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight
When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything yeah
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings

Sly's the original originator
James screams (uh-uh)
Marvin was the only innovator
(Innovator)
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare

On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days

And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
I've been sad
And have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning
There's a good wind to blow me home
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can
I will have my ever after

The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me

Life is glowing inside you and me
Please take my hand, right here where I stand
Won't you come out and dance with me, oh
Come see
And lovers try
'Til they get the best of the night
And come morning
They are tangled up in the light
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
And they love while they can
And they think about the night so sweet

Is This Love,"I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end
Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring
I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me
It's not just a physical rush
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough
Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart
Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand
I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'

Can make you run for cover

Is like a lust for gold

Brilliant Disguise,"I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away
I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found
So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?
I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me
So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?
Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself
Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter
The gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?
Tonight our bed is cold
Lost in the darkness of our love

Who doubts what he's sure of"

And now's the time to begin it
You found a new world and you want to taste it
But that world can turn cold and you better face it
Who will you run to when it all falls down?
Who's gonna pick your world up off from the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I?
You don't know what it's like to live on your own
You've always had me there beside you
You think it's easy finding someone out there
Who's gonna care as much as I do?
What's gonna happen baby when you find out
That there's no one there to cry to?
You can tell the whole world how you're gonna make it
You can follow your heart but what ya do when someone breaks it?
Who will you run to when it all falls down?
Who's gonna pick your world up off from the ground?
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry?
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I?
You found a new world and you want to taste it
But that world can turn cold and you better face it
Who will you run to when it all falls down?

If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by
Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile
Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile
Once in a while two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street
Suddenly, thunder showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain
But there's something in the air
Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday
Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the mode of fashion
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong"
Doing It All For My Baby,"Early in the morning
I'm still in bed
She comes to me
With sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses
""Hello sleepyhead""
And gets me moving
In the right direction
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
I'm doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me
Later in the evening
It's been a busy day
She lays her head
Upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing
Snuggle up and say
Now I'm with you baby
The loneliness is over
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me
Doing it all for my baby
'Cause she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me
Doing it doing it - doing it doing it doing it yea
Doing it doing it - ooh ooh ooh
Doing it (doing it) doing it (doing it)
Doing it doing it doing it yea
Doing it (doing it) doing it (doing it) - ooh ooh ooh

Ballerina Girl,"Ballerina girl
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you
You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away
You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you
I only want to say
I love you
Ballerina girl
The joy you bring me
Every day and night
Holding you tight
How I've waited for your love
Sometimes I've wondered
If you'd ever come my way
Now that I've finally found you
This is where my heart will stay, whoa-oh
I'm never gonna break your heart
Never will we drift apart
'Cause all I wanna do
Is share my whole life with you
'Cause you make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
I guess I finally realized
There's nothing else like loving you, oh-oh
Ballerina girl
You are so lovely
I can see in you
My dreams come true
Don't you ever go away

Something wrong inside

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is
When you're in it
I've been in love before

A dangerous dance
One small word can make me feel
Like running away
You can't say you're in it, no,
Until you reach the limit

Sweet Child O' Mine,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Whoa, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

The Flame,"Another night slowly closes in

Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
Watching shadows move across the wall
I feel so frightened
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door
I saw you smile and my mind
Could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you?
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours
How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise
What happens now
Do we break another rule
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more
Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
Hold on to the nights"

Love Bites - Remastered 2017,"When you make love
Do you look in your mirror?
Who do you think of
Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies
And say that it's forever?
Do you think twice
Or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone
Do you let go?
Are you wild and willin'
Or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause makin' love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it, no
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need
When I'm with you
Are you somewhere else?
Am I gettin' through
Or do you please yourself?
When you wake up
Will you walk out?
It can't be love
If you throw it about
Ooh, babe
I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cause makin' love to you might drive me crazy, oh
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need
Oh, yeah
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause makin' love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it, no
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
No
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need"
Endless Summer Nights,"Summer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before
Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh
Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights (Oh I remember)
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights"
Foolish Beat,"Oh
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four-leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you (oh)
I could never love again the way that I loved you (oh)
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
I could never love again the way that I loved you (oh)
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody?
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone
Oh oh oh
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I could never love again
Now that we're apart
Now that we're apart, oh
I could never love again
Now that we're apart"
Angel,"I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
Don't know what I'm gonna do 'bout this feeling inside
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
Come and save me tonight
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby, baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Yeah, come and make it alright
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight

Hazy Shade of Winter,"… Time, time, time
See what's become of me
… Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
… I was so hard to please
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
… Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
There's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
… Carry a cup in your hand
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
… Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again
… Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life
… Seasons change with the scenery
Weavin' time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?
… Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
… Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
… Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
… Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground"
Make Me Lose Control,"I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of flame in the midsummer heat, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playing ""Uptown"" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago
My darlin'

We put the top down and park with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like a fire in July, oh yeah

Oh, oh, oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
I ain't got a fever, I got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy

Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand

Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go? (Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo)

That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby, why don't we go? (Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo)

Go down to Kokomo

Should've Known Better,"Another sleepless night I can't explain
Somebody said they heard me call your name
The radio won't let you leave my mind
I know it's over but I don't know why
Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you
There was no risk that I wouldn't take
And not a promise that I didn't make
All I asked was that you just hold on
And now I'm wondering what I did wrong
Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you
I gave you all of my body and soul
Never believing we might lose control
I took my hands off the wheel
I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane
Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you"
Make It Real,"Tonight it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on
Hear me cryin' out to you
You said, ""Never, never would I leave""
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real
In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart I'll pretend
That you are here again
Hear me cryin' out to you
You said, ""Never, never would I leave""
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real
Give me one more chance to
Make it real"
Out of the Blue,"Without you, without you
I always thought that everything was fine without you
Never knowing you'd be mine
Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
what love was, what love was
I need you, oh I need you
And everyday I love you more and more
Without you (dreams and tears)
I know what it's all for
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's ok
Don't know why I feel this way
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
what love was, what love was
Here with you
We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay (Out of the blue)
It's like a dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
Here with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true,

Out of the blue
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue"
Perfect World - Single Edit,"Everybody's dreamin' 'bout a perfect world
Where you could have everything your heart desires
A perfect boy will meet a perfect girl
And their perfect love will set the world on fire
Well what you gonna do, when one and one makes three
And a vision of the future is impossible to see
Nobody's perfect, not even a perfect fool,
But if you'll have faith in me
I'll keep the faith with you
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Everybody's got secrets, now you know that it's true
They talk about me and they'll talk about you
Something happens to the pledges of trust
Down through the years they begin to rust
Now here we are amid the tears and the laughter
Still waiting for our happily ever after
We'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can
Try to remember and you'll understand
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world"

When It's Love,"Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control
Oh, how do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
When it's love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

I Hate Myself for Loving You,"Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not getting jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart, and you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey man, bet you can't treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you beggin', say, ""Forget it"" just for spite
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart, and you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart, and you took my pride away
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you

I Don't Want to Live Without You,"I find myself in a strange situation
And I don't know how
What seemed to be an infatuation
Is so different now
I can't get by if we're not together
Ooh can't you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
Close to me
I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
Hoping that you will promise to be mine
And never go away
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love
I ask myself but there's no explanation
For the way I feel
I know I've reached the right destination
And I know it's real
I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
When I'll be giving you this heart of mine
Believe me when I say
I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love
Now I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never be without you
Be without your love

Don't You Know What The Night Can Do?,"Hear the night music playing?
Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever
Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there too
Now's the time our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying
Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?
Time to show all your feelings
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you
Now we turn into music
Now we never will lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide
There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in
All this love for the taking
Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through?
Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?
Know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Cherry Bomb,"Well, I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile
That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
The winter days, they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say, ""Do you remember when""
That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
17 has turned 35
I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any harm
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughin' too loud
When they hear me talkin' like, this to you
That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant so much, baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really pumpin'
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Never Tear Us Apart,"Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart
I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
Mm, you were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
You (Don't ask me)
You were standing (You know it's true)
I was there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
I-I-I
I was standing
You were there"
Valerie,"So wild, standing there
With her hands in her hair
I can't help remember
Just where she touched me
There's still no face
Here in her place
So cool, she was like
Jazz on a Summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be
Love songs fill the night
But they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry out
Just like they're dying
Her cries hang there
In time, somewhere
Someday, some good wind
May blow her back to me
Some night I may hear
Her like she used to be
No it can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be
So cool, she was like
Jazz on a Summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in your arms
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be
I'm the same boy I used to be"
Just Like Paradise,"Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo
With the big guitars
And that's all right
I got the itch
And a restless soul
She gone with the wind
Gonna go for broke tonight
And that's all night
Girl, we've been meant for this
Since we were born
No problems now (the coast is clear)
It's just the calm before the storm
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't want to go home
Suzy, Suzy, Girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves
You make me eat my heart out
Nightly
And that's all right with me!
No special favors
Make it out to cash
We'll spend it later
Got to make this romance last
That's it, that's it
Some folks say ""easy come is easy go""
(And some folks say)
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't want to go home"

How can I resist,
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time

Look Away - 2009 Remaster,"When you called me up this morning
Told me 'bout the new love you found
I said I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you
Found someone else
I guess I won't be comin' 'round
I guess it's over baby
It's really over baby, whoa-oh
And for what you said
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's got to be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news OK
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby look away
And if we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way
When we both agreed as lovers
We we're be better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, oh-oh, oh
I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared
To hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby this is how we wanted it to be
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby look away
And if we meet on the streets someday

Every Rose Has Its Thorn - Remastered 2003,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn"
Wind Beneath My Wings,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings"
Right Here Waiting,"Oceans apart, day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever?
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it, baby?
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end, if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh, can't you see it, baby?
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you"
Lost in Your Eyes,"I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?
I get weak, in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause, when I'm lost I can let go
I don't mind not knowin' what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you
And if I can't find my way
If salvation is words away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes
I don't mind not knowin' what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
Oh, it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes"
Heaven,"Got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray, but man, they're really coming back
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
I don't need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah
Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back and makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
I know it's gonna find a way

Whoa-whoa-oh
Heaven
Whoa-whoa-oh
Heaven
It's not too far away, have hope
Whoa-whoa-oh

She Drives Me Crazy,"I can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'rounds killin' me
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed
Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I won't make it
On my own
No one likes
To be alone
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy

Two Hearts,"Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
'Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
'Cause she's always there to behind you, just to remind you
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Well, there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together 'til the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever 'til the end of time
She knows (she knows)
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together until the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever 'til the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind, just one mind, just one mind
You know we're two hearts, two hearts believing in just one mind"
Listen To Your Heart,"I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of Heaven turns too dark
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before, oh
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before
You tell him goodbye
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it)
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart (take a, take a listen to it)
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart (oh, oh)
Listen to your heart (oh, ooh, oh)
Listen to your heart (oh, oh, oh)

I'll Be There For You,"I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love, it's suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
Yeah, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(Oh, woman, you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, oh
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I wasn't there when you were happy
(I wasn't there to make you happy)
And I wasn't there when you were down, down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
Oh
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

If You Don't Know Me by Now - 2008 Remaster,"Sing the song, everybody
C'mon
If you don't know me by now (wunderbar)
You will never, never, never know me
Oooh
Now all the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To upset our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
You know we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight
If you don't know me, baby
(You will never never never know me)
No, you won't (oooh)
Oooh, yeah, c'mon
Oh, if you don't know me, girl
(You will never never never know me)
You... (Uuuh)
We've all got
Our own funny moods
I've got mine
I bet you woman you've got yours too
You better trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye
If you don't know me, baby
(You will never never never know me)
No, you won't (Oooh)
No, you won't, no, you won't, no, you won't
Twenty long years we've been together

Well...

No, you won't (oooh)"
The Living Years,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Oh, crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence
Say it loud (say it loud), say it clear (oh say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (it's too late) when we die (oh when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay
So say it loud, say it clear (oh say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
Because it's too late, it's too late (it's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Say it loud, say it clear (oh say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (it's too late) when we die (it's too late when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So say it, say it, say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (come on say it clear)
Say it loud
(Don't give up, don't give in and don't look away 'til it's too late)
Say it clear
Say it loud (say it loud, say it loud)"
Eternal Flame,"Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling

Do you understand? Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?
I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?

Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain

When I See You Smile,"Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through,
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world's closing in on me,
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me
Sometimes I want to give up
I want to give in, I want to quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright, everything's alright
When I see you smile
I can face the world,
Oh oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light,
Oh oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Oh yeah, baby when I see you smile at me
Baby there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
And when the rain is falling
I don't feel it, 'cause you're here with me now
And one look at you baby
Is all I'll ever need, you're all I'll ever need
When I see you smile
I can face the world,
Oh oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light,
Oh oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Oh yeah, baby when I see you smile at me

Born To Be My Baby,"Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight
If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan

My back was turned (hey, hey, hey) and she was gone

Once Bitten Twice Shy,"Well the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels
You didn't know what rock 'n' roll was
Until you met my drummer on the grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah
Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh, so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
You didn't know how rock 'n' roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parkin' lot
By the look in her eye she was givin' what she got
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
Ah, woman, you're a mess, gonna die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
You didn't know that rock 'n' roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
I said my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
Alright!
I didn't know you had a rock 'n' roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark as it's done
Oh my, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy babe
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice shy baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten twice, shy
So shy
Oh so shy
So shy, baby
So shy
So shy, so shy
So, so shy, so shy"

"Soldier Of Love - 12"" Version","So you heard that I'm a rebel with a heart made of stone.
I got a restless spirit that nobody can own.
If a picture tells a story won't you listen to mine,
I'm searching for the answer but it's so hard to find.
You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines,
'Cause there's a fire burning in my eye.
Like a thief in the night, who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'Cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.
I'm willing to fight.
Love can be so heartless when you turn out the lights,
A mutual surrender in the heat of the night.
Life's an empty picture when you're living alone,
Well, maybe that's the reason every heart needs a home.
Each time I fall down, I get on my feet again.
I'm gonna win this battle in the end.
Like a thief in the night, who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'Cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.
You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines,
'Cause there's a fire burning in my eye.
Like a thief in the night who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'Cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.

When the Children Cry,"Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
When the children cry let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
'Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God
When the children cry let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God
When the children cry let them know we tried
When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins"
18 and Life,"Ricky was a young boy
He had a heart of stone
Lived 9 to 5 and he worked
His fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school
He came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade
So no one could take him down, oh no
He had no money
No, no good at home
He walked the streets a soldier
And he fought the world alone and now it's
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go
Tequila in his heartbeat
His veins full of gasoline
He kept his motor running
But it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure
Ricky's the wild one
He married trouble
And had a courtship with a gun
Bang-bang shoot 'em up
The party never ends
You can't think of dying
When the bottle's your best friend and now it's
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go, ye-yeah
Accidents will happen?
They all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind
That child blew a child away, ye-yeah
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go
18 and life, you got it
18 and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's 18 and life to go"
I Don't Want Your Love - 2010 Remaster,"I don't mind, if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care
'Cause you've got something I can share
Hey, take your chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the light
Of your second sight
Because when you understand me
You might feel good around me now
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
I won't turn you out, if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realize
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination, now pick it up
I don't want your love to bring me down

I don't want your love so turn it around

Your rhythm is the power, to move me
It's something you control, completely
I don't want your love, I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)
I like noise, 'cause I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down, I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me
You might feel good around me, now back it up
Your rhythm is the power, to move me
It's something you control, completely

Second Chance,"Since you been gone
I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' gray
All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay

When love makes this sound babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down babe
Can't you see I love you
Since you been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over
I just can't say goodbye
So this is love
Standing in the pouring rain
I fooled on you
But she never meant a thing
And I know I ain't got no right
To ask you to sympathize
But why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget the past
When love makes this sound babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down babe
Can't you see I love you
Since you been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over
I just can't say goodbye
I never loved her, I never needed her
She was willing and that's all there is to say
Don't forsake me, please don't leave me now
A heart needs a second chance
Yeah, you been gone and I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over
I just can't say goodbye
Please forgive me and forget it
I was wrong and I admit it
But why can't we talk it over
Why can't we forget about
Forget about the past
A heart needs a second chance
When love makes this sound babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down babe
You been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance

Close My Eyes Forever,"Baby
I get so scared inside, and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind, or is it fantasy?
Heaven
Is in the palm of my hand, and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Sometimes
It's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems
When you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger
And stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain
But would you ever trust me?
No, I'll never feel the same, oh
I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me"
All This Time,"All this time

Something that you left behind

All this time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines, the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes and make a wish
Hoping you'll remember
All this time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines, the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
Say goodbye
A bond will make another time
Don't be sorry if you cry
I'll be crying too

Just think about it
Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right, is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to
So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the mornin' when he woke
All I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower, you are the seed
We walked in the garden, we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to, oh
Ooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love
Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes
I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh-oh
Was the one little thing that you can""
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
C'mon, say you will, you want me, too
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too
All night long (all I wanna do is make love to you)
All night long (all I wanna do)
All night long (all I wanna do is make love to you)
All night long (all I wanna do)
All I wanna do (is make love to you)
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew, yeah (all I wanna do)
(All I wanna do is make love to you)
All night long (all I wanna do)
All night long"
Release Me,"I know that it's time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will you still feel the same?
How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't want to give up
But baby it's time I had two feet on the ground
Can you release me
Can you release me
Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me
Come on baby, come on baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we want to be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby you've just got to release me
Release me
Release me
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find
What you're looking for
Come on baby, come on baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we want to be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby you've just got to release me
Release me
Release me
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find
What you're looking for
What is this power you've got on me
What is this power, Oh
What is it, What is it
Come on baby, come on baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we want to be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on Darlin', hear me Darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me

Will you release me
Ah...Release me
Will you release me"
Don't Know Much (with Aaron Neville),"Look at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know
Look at these eyes
They've never seen what mattered
Look at these dreams
So beaten and so battered
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know
So many questions
Still left unanswered
So much
I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me
Sometimes I see so clearly
The only truth I've ever known
Is me and you
Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation
I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know
I don't know much
But I know I love you
That may be
All I need to know
I don't know much
But I know I love you
That may be
All there is to know"
She Ain't Worth It,"You better make tracks fast on the double
The girl jazz you but she's nothing but trouble
Take her where she wants to go
And ev'ry day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude and leads you off and leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?
One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end, think again
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you
She gets you but then leaves you cold
And keeps you waitin' on the phone
'cause you know you'll alway give her on more try
I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried
One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble
Give her ev'rything you have all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you"

Get out of my way, get out of my sight

I Don't Have the Heart,"Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me
I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to
Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can
'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to
You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh, no
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart to hurt you

Downtown Train,"Outside another yellow moon
Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh, if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh, baby
Can't you hear me now?
Can't you hear me now?
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night it's just the same
On a downtown train
I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night, it's just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night, it's just the same
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
All my dreams, all my dreams, fall like rain
On a downtown train
On a downtown train
All my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train"

Do You Remember? - 2016 Remaster,"We never talked about it

Price of Love,"Girl, sometimes it seems to me
That I don't say the things I should, to you, I act like I'm no good
You wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share
Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need
And through the good and bad times, you have always been there
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, never dream of giving up
That's the price of love
Look, sometimes it makes us cry
Forgive me when I get it wrong, sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around, I'd find a way somehow
This time, you see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends
And through the good and bad times, you have always been there
We hold each other tight, you tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, never think of giving up
That's the price of love
Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need

The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should have heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block was dancing to the Jail house Rock
A-ah-ah-ah
A-ah-ah-ah
A-ah-ah-ah
At the hop, hop, hop-hop-hop
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die
If you're not there
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through
But even if I wanted 2 I couldn't really truly 'cause my only friend is you
Come on
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and you could have been a work of art
Thieves in the temple
Baby don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love please help me be
The better man
Better than the thieves in the temple
In the temple tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight
Hurt me
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple
you said you loved me! (Thieves in the temple)
you said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple)
you were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the
Temple}
you lie! Love come (Lie!) In a hurry (Lie!)
Thieves in the temple tonight
You got a smile so bright
You know you could've been a candle.
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle.
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And baby you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume
Well you could've been anything
That you wanted to, I can tell
The way you do the things you do, alright.
The way you do the things you do.
As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could've been an our
The way you stole my heart
You know you could've been a crook
And baby you're so smart
You know you could've been a schoolbook
Well you could've been anything
That you wanted to, I can tell
The way you do the things you do, alright.
The way you do the things you do.
You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could've been some honey"
What Kind of Man Would I Be?,"Girl, well it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand
Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
Oh I just want to run to you
You pull me through
Oh baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their life?
Tell me: what kind of man would I be
Living a life without any meaning?
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?
Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever was gone with one touch of your hand
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, oh baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go
Tell me: what kind of man would I be
Living a life without any meaning?
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?"
Love Shack,"If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says
Fifteen miles to the, love shack, love shack yeah

I Go to Extremes,"Call me a joke, call me a fool
Right at this moment I'm totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
No I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Out of the dark, into the light
Either I'm wrong, perfectly right
I don't know why"
Oh Girl,"Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be
All my friends call me a fool
They say, ""let the woman take care of you""
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh-oh-oh
Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do
I know I got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh yeah
Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I've gotta get away from here
Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how"
When I'm Back On My Feet Again,"Gonna break these chains around me
Gonna learn to fly again
May be hard, may be hard, but I'll do it
When I'm back on my feet again
Soon these tears will all be dryin'
Soon these eyes will see the sun
Might take time, might take time, but I'll see it
When I'm back on my feet again
When I'm back on my feet again
I'll walk proud down this street again
And they'll all look at me again
And they'll see that I'm strong
Gonna hear the children laughing
Gonna hear the voices sing
Won't be long, won't be long 'til I hear them
When I'm back on my feet again
Gonna feel the sweet light of heaven
Shining down its light on me
One sweet day, one sweet day I will feel it
When I'm back on my feet again
When I'm back on my feet again
I'll walk proud down this street again
And they'll all look at me again
And they'll see that I'm strong
And I'm not gonna crawl again
I will learn to stand tall again
No, I'm not gonna fall again
'Cause I'll learn to be strong
Soon these tears will all be dryin'
Soon these eyes will see the sun
Won't be long, won't be long 'til I see it
When I'm back on my feet again
When I'm back on my feet again
I'll be back on my feet again"
What It Takes,"There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah!
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Girl, before I met you
I was F-I-N-E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep
All your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep
With the devil in your eyes
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Guitar!
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice
No no no no no
'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise
Let go, let go, let go
I don't wanna burn in paradise
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go (I don't wanna burn)
Let it go, let it go, let it go (I don't wanna burn)
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go"
Without You,"Without you, there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl, you never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
Let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you"
High Enough,"I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy
We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say
When you called me ""baby""
Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way
Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
And yesterday is just a memory
Yesterday is just a memory
And I don't want to live without you anymore
Can't you see I'm in misery?
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do
When you call me ""baby""
Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way
Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
And yesterday is just a memory, I'm running
I was running for the door
(Oh-woah)
The next thing I remember
(Oh-woah)
I was running back for more
(Oh-woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh-whoa, all the way (all the way)
(All the way, yeah)
Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh
Can you take me high enough
Won't you fly me over (won't you fly me over)
Yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over
Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh, Whoa-oh"
From a Distance,"From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance, we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance
From a distance, you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting's for
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man (every man)
It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
This is the song for every man
And God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance
Oh, God is watching us
God is watching
God is watching us
From a distance"
Joyride,"Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need a book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend
She says, ""hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride""
Join the joyride
She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no
'Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)
She says, ""hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride""
Join the joyride
She says, ""hello (hello), you fool (you fool), I love you (I love you)
C'mon join the joyride""
Be a joyrider, ow
I'll take you on a sky ride
I'm feeling like I'm spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby
She says, ""hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you)
C'mon join the joyride""
Join the joyride
Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

You're In Love,"Open the door and come in,
I'm so glad to see you my friend,
I don't know how long it's been
Havin' these feelings again
And now I see that you're so happy, and oohhh
It just sets me free and
I like to see us as good friends as we used to be
My love,
You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me, oohhh
It's enough for me to know that you're in love
Now I let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That you're never coming back for me
I had this dream that you'd always be by my side
Ooh, I could've died
But now I see that you're so happy (see that you're so happy)
Ooohh, It just sets me free and
I'd like to see us as good friends as we used to be
My love
You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me, oohh
It's enough for me to know that you're in love
I can let you go
'Cause I know that you are in love
I tried to find you
But you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday (someday), someday (someday)
Woohhh, you're in love
Ooohh It's enough for me to know that you're in love,
Oooh, now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love
No no no no no no ooh"
Losing My Religion,"Oh life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper, of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this the hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, fly, try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream"
Fading Like A Flower (Every Time You Leave),"In a time
Where the sun descends alone
I ran a long, long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone
I will try
I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes
Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Tell me why
When I scream, there's no reply
When I reach out, there's nothing to find
When I sleep, I break down and cry
Cry, yeah
Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Beaten by the storm
Talking to myself
Getting washed by the rain
It's such a cold, cold town
Ooh, it's such a cold town
Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a
Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away

Hole Hearted,"Oh yeah wooh
Hey hey hey hey hey yeah
Life's ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted [Repeat: x2]
This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay kep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do
There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I'd fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted [Repeat: x6]
Yeah"
Impulsive,"The secret of love, I thought I understood
the way it's supposed to be.
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart.
But now you're running away with my heart
I don't wanna think about it,
don't wanna think clear, don't analyze what I'm doing here.
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose myself in your kiss.
Arrows through hearts drawn on a misty window.
You're taking me home in the rain.
My heart is beating. Don't say no.
My head keeps saying take it slow.
I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear,
don't analyze what I'm doing here.
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose myself in your kiss.
You're giving me a feeling it's a sudden rush.
Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous.
Wo wo oh.
This is not like me to follow my heart so easily.
I am reckless, impulsive.
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart.
But you're running away with my heart, my heart.
I don't wanna think about it,
don't wanna think clear, don't analyze what I'm doing here.
Wanna be impulsive, reckless and lose myself in your kiss.
You're givin' feeling.
It's a sudden rush.
Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous.
Wanna be impulsive, reckless, and lose my self in your kiss.
Impulsive, I wanna be impulsive.
I'm gonna be impulsive, reckless and lose myself,"
Love Is a Wonderful Thing,"Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means
The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture, it's just a matter of fact
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Oh yeah
The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally
The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define, oh no
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Oh, when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love gonna keep on growin', just keep on growin'
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing, oh yeah
I'll say it again and again
And turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
It's love, love, love is a wonderful
Love, love, love is a wonderful
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing"
Rhythm of My Heart,"Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slippin' away
Let me still exist in another place
Runnin' undercover of a helicopter blade
The flames are gettin' higher in effigy
Burnin' down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'
Photographs, kerosine
Light my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Runnin' down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'
Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shiftin' like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yankin' back the handle, no expression on my face
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'
The rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'"
Something To Talk About,"People are talking, talking 'bout people
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under cover
I'll just ignore it, but they keep saying
We laugh just a little too loud
Stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they're seeing something we don't, darlin'
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous
Could you be falling for me?
It took a rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinking 'bout you everyday
Dreaming 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darlin'
Let's give 'em something to talk about
A little mystery to figure out, babe
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love, love, love?
Let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
A little mystery to figure out
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
Ooh, listen up, baby
A little mystery won't hurt

How about our love, love, love, love?
How about love, love, love?"
Can't Stop This Thing We Started,"Yeah
Baby, I'm coming to get you
You might stop a hurricane

You might have a dozen other guys
But if you wanna stop me, baby, don't even try

Show Me The Way,"Every night I say a prayer in the hope that there's a heaven
And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way
And as I slowly drift to sleep, for a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid that I just won't know
Show me the way, Show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way
And if I see your light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way
Every night I say a prayer
In the hope that there's a heaven"
Cry for Help - Single Edit,"She's taken my time.
Convince me she's fine.
But when she leaves I'm not so sure.
Its always the same.
She's playing her game.
And when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems.
Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all.
The rain on my face,
It covers the trace
Of all the tears Id had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.

Signs - Live At The Trocadero / 1990,"And the sign says ""long hair freaky people need not apply""

Something To Believe In - Remastered,"Well I see him on the TV
Preaching 'bout the promised lands
He tells me ""believe in Jesus""
Steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
Lord I think he sinned, yeah yeah
Twenty two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friends in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""forgive me for what I done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down an' cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
See my smile it fades again
Uh, give me something to believe in (Uh, give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
Uh, give me something to believe in, yeah (Uh, give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
Things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home
I drive by the homeless sleepin' on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
Used to read ""Jesus saves""
A mile away live the rich folk
And I see how they're livin' it up
But while the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich are drinkin' from the golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose and so few win, ha
Give me something to believe in (uh, give me something to believe in)
Give me something to believe in (uh, give me something to believe in)

Silent Lucidity - Remastered 2003,"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you, leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day, your dream is over
Or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run to in the night
Relax child, you were there
Only didn't realize, and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you'll hear and see
This magic, new dimension
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you
In silent lucidity
Visualize your dream (yes)
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form (yes)
If you persist in your efforts, you can achieve dream control (help me)
How are we feeling today, better?
Dream control (help me)
Dream control (help me)
Dream control (help me)
Dream control (help me)
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you"
Disappear,"Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on TV
Pain and suffering
And the struggle to be free
It can't ever be denied
And I never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all
You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear
Say you're mine
And give yourself to the feelings that you know
I'm needing all that you can give me
All the things that you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells as the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays
You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear
You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Say if I could
Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see
Or make sense of the dealings
Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realize all that I am
You put the light inside this man
You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear
You're so fine
Lose my mind

All This Time,"I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog
And an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses
Walking home in the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea
Two priests came round
Our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows
And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea
Blessed are the poor
For they shall inherit the earth
One is better to be poor
Than a fat man in the eye of a needle
As these words were spoken
I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world,
And how could it be worth having?
And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly,
To the sea.
All this time
The river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists,
Then how come he never lived here?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Teachers told us
The Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the
Empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled
Till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found
And all this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
They only get better one by one
One by one
One by one, by one
One by one
I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog
And an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses
Walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night"
I Saw Red,"Ooh yeah
Ooh it must be magic
How inside your eyes
I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place
Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright
Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
I've been hurt
And I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way
Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
Mmh, and I didn't need to see his face
Oh I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Ooh it must be magic"
Miles Away,"So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
The months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for
Some times, just for a moment,
I reach out, hope you're still there
Miles away,
No, you're never turnin' back,
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away,
Nothin' left of what we had,
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away,
No, you're never turnin' back,
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away,
Nothin' left of what we had,
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away
When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone, I'm so tired of bein' alone
With only your promises
The lonliness just fades away,
Thoughts of you, just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
If you hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away,
No, you're never turnin' back,
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away,
Nothin' left of what we had,
Just when I needed you the most, whoa-oh
Miles away,
No, you're never turnin' back,
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away,
Nothin' left of what we had,

Save The Best For Last,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're lookin' for
Is the one thing you can't see
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for last"

I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?

And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeah
Love is always coming, love is always going
No one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?
Oh, oh, oh
Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way

A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey
Yay
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial"
When a Man Loves a Woman,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it ought to be
When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And baby baby please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man
When a man loves a woman"
I Can't Dance - 2007 Remaster,"Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun makin' me sweat
Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet
I can't dance
I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance
I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything
Blue jeans sittin' on the beach
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach
Mhm, she's got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt
'Cause I can't dance
I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance
I can't sing
I'm just standing here sellin'
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's lookin' on
Young punk spillin' beer on my shoes
Fat guy's talkin' to me tryin' to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shootin' pool
But I can't dance
I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance
I can't sing
I'm just standing here sellin'
Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face
Mhm
No, I can't dance
I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance
I can't sing
I'm just standing here sellin' everything
No, I can't walk
No, I can't dance
No, no, no, I can't dance
No, I said, I can't sing"
Hazard,"My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
And saw the man inside
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went a walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
Oh I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town
Ooh-hooh-hooh"
Hold on My Heart - 2007 Remaster,"Hold on my heart
Just hold on to that feeling
We both know we've been here before
We both know what can happen
Hold on my heart
'cause I'm looking over you shoulder
Please don't rush in this time
Don't show her how you feel
Hold on my heart
Throw me a lifeline
I'll keep a place for you
Somewhere deep inside
Hold on my heart
Please tell her to be patient
'Cause there has never been a time
That I wanted something more
If I can recall this feeling
And I know there's a chance
Oh I will be there
Yes I will be there
Be there for you
Whenever you want me to
Whenever you call I will be there
Yes I will be there
Hold on my heart
Don't let her see you crying
No matter where I go
She'll always be with me
Hold on my heart
Just hold on to that feeling
We both know we've been here before
We both know what can happen
So hold on my heart"

No Son of Mine - 2007 Remaster,"Well the key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was: how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out?
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine
I didn't think much about it
'Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen that night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying
Of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again
They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine
Oh, his words how they hurt me
I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by
I lived to regret it
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do?
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help
Oh I came here for you
Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away?
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back
They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
But I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
And he looked me straight in the eyes
He said
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
When you walked out you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine
Oh, his words how they hurt me
I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by
I lived to regret it
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go and what should I do?
You're no son, you're no son of mine
Well I came here for help, oh I was looking for you
You're no son, you're no son of mine oh
You're no son ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah

Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate
Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown
And just smile at the sound
Sleek as a shriek, spinning 'round and 'round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you

But that don't change the way I feel about you
If you think all this might be bringing me down
Look again cause I ain't wearin' no frown
I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
Put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it gonna go
You think it's sad well that's too bad
'Cause I'm havin' a ball and never cared a thing about
You
Everything about you, everything about you
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you"
Thought I'd Died And Gone To Heaven,"Love is forever as I lie awake
Beside you
I believed, there's no heaven
No hideaway, for the lonely
But I was wrong, crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right
Only wanted to stay a while (Woah, woah, woah)
Only wanted to play a while (Woah, woah, woah)

Missing You Now (feat. Kenny G),"I talk to you but it's not the same as touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name, I want to run to you
Well be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait 'till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now
Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer
It's so hard on my soul
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you baby

Till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart
Right here in my arms
Then and only then
Will I be satisfied
I'm missing you now
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long

Get up and move your sleepy head, don't shake my tree

It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me wanna scream!
Bach, Tchaikovsky violins
Turn it off! That ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?
Seven-day weekend, up all night

I Can't Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't"
The River of Dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night"

Come on forget the King who... marry me! (just go ahead now)
Come on, come on, come on (just go ahead now)
Go ahead now
Just go ahead now
If you want to buy me flowers
Go ahead now"
Have I Told You Lately - 2008 Remaster,"Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
For the morning sun and all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
You fill my life with laughter
And somehow, you make it better
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one
Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one
And have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do"
Ordinary World,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well, now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every one
Is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any one
Is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any one
Is my world"
I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) - Single Edit,"Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before or will again
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the bays are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it
I would do anything for love
I know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love but I won't do that
I won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do
But I'll never stop dreaming of you
Every night of my life, no way
But I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
Oh, I won't do that
Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Can you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
No, I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that"
Come Undone,"Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
""Happy birthday to you"" was created for you
Ah, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real?
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you need?
Who do you love?
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
Who do you love?
When you come undone
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)"
I Don't Wanna Fight,"There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe)
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more
This is time for letting go
I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Oh, can't you see that I don't care
Or are you you looking right through me
It seems to me that lately
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really want to fight no more (too much talking babe)
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more (tired of all these games)
But baby, don't you know
That I don't want to hurt no more (it's time, I'm walking, babe)
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really want to fight no more
This is time for letting go
Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
No, I don't want to hurt no more
But baby, don't you know
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much talking, babe)
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more
This is time for letting go
No, I don't want to hurt no more (too much, hey baby)
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really want to fight no more
'Cause it's time for letting go"
Cats In The Cradle,"My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew he said
""I'm gonna be like you, dad""
""You know I'm gonna be like you""
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?""
I said, ""Not today, I got a lot to do""
He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away and he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, "" yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
When he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""I'm proud of you""
""Could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later""
""Can I have them, please?""
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time""
""You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, dad""
""It's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home?
Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then..."
Do You Believe In Us,"I tremble inside just thinking
About the world around us

Este momento vivir
My vida yo, trataré de olvidarte
Pero la luz de tus ojos
Brilla, eres un ángel

To Love Somebody,"There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
To live with you, to live with you
There's a way
Everybody says
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, I ain't got you
Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you
In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very blind
I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, if I ain't got you?
Baby, you don't know what it's like

Fields Of Gold,"You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold
So she took her love
For to gaze a while
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold
Will you stay with me?
Will you be my love?
Upon the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold"
Faithful,"Don't cry baby, kiss me and say farewell
Nothing's going to break the spell.
And if you're thinking time will tell

Reason To Believe,"If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still, I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd try to leave all the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still, I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it easy to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it hard to give
Never think about myself

Break It Down Again,"Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh
Break it down again

And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
Oo, oo. Oo, oo
In the world of secrets
In the world of sound
Oo, oo
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love, and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste sleeping underground (break it down again)
I want to break it down (break it down again)
Break it down again
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
Oo, oo. Oo, oo
In the world of silence
In the world of sound
Oo, oo
""No sleep for the dreaming"" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice?
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day
And all the love, and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste sleeping underground (break it down again)
I want to break it down (break it down again)
Horsing around
Pray to the power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer Won't simmer
Won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
Play to the crowd
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Last off to heaven just like moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone else somewhere else
Could show you something new to help with the ups and downs
Break it down again
I want to break it down Break it down again
Break it down again (break it down again)
Break it down again (break it down again)
Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming"

If I Ever Lose My Faith In You,"You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy Church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse, but
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face
I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse, but
Let me say this first
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do"
Two Steps Behind - String / Acoustic Version,"Walk away, if you want to
It's okay, if you need to
You can run but you can never hide

There's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all

That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yea, yea
Take the time
To think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around you'll see what you can find
Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me
Now there's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all, no
Whatever you do

And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around

Now And Forever,"Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way, but still you
Seem to understand
Now and forever
I will be your man
Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That Heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you
Each and every way I can
Now and forever
I will be your man
Now, I can rest my worries
And always be sure
That I won't be alone, anymore
If I'd only known you were there
All the time
All this time!
Until the day the ocean
Doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever
I will be your man
Now and forever
I will be your man"
Shine,"Give me a word

Said I Loved You...But I Lied,"Ooh-ooh, ooh
You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
'Til the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one
Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you, but I lied
With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep, so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun, yeah
Need you forever and I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one
Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
I said I loved you, but I lied
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one
Said I loved you, but I lied (said I loved you, but I lied)
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside (said I loved you, but I lied)
Said I loved you, but I was wrong (said I loved you, but I'm wrong)
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you (said I loved you)

Said I loved you, but I lied"
All I Wanna Do,"Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me
'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"
I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) - Single Edit,"Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before or will again
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the bays are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it
I would do anything for love
I know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love but I won't do that
I won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do
But I'll never stop dreaming of you
Every night of my life, no way
But I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
Oh, I won't do that
Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Can you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
No, I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that"
Loser,"In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double-barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
That's choking on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheeze whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)
Yo, bring it on down
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Found Out About You,"All last summer, in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine
Forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies
Months roll past the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
The things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won
You give for free
Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about
Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM Radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out
Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Whispers at the bus stop
Well, I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
I found out about you"
Streets of Philadelphia - Single Edit,"I was bruised and battered
I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window
And didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the streets of Philadelphia?
I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
A thousand miles just to slip this skin
The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia?"
Crazy,"Come here, baby
You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're making up more than we're making love
And it always seems you got something on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
Say you're leaving on a seven thirty train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feeling bad looks good, yeah
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy
Crazy, crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
You're packing up your stuff
And talking like it's tough
And trying to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!
But, I know you ain't wearin' nothing underneath that over coat
And it's all a show, yeah!
That kinda loving
Makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah!
That kinda loving, yeah
Now I'm never, never, never gonna be the same
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on, then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy
Crazy, crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
I'm losing my mind, girl
'Cause I'm going cra
I need your love, honey, yeah!
I need your love
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
'Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on then, you're gone
Yeah, you drive me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, now baby, baby, baby, baby"
Mary Jane's Last Dance,"She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' on, keep movin' on""
Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again
Well, I don't know but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwing up, tired of goin' down
Tired of myself, tired of this town
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long
Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again
There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You've got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit the last number, I walked to the road
Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again"
Everyday - 2015 Remastered,"I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothin' more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay
So everyday I cry, (everyday)
Yes, everyday I fall, (everyday)
You ever wonder why, (everyday)
Why I love everythin' about you?
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Til then every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you, but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by, (everyday)
And everyday I fall, (everyday)
It makes me wonder why, (everyday)
My life's worth nothing without you?
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Cause every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No, you'll never see
The book closes, and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away, (everyday)
Try, try, try as I may, (Everyday)
I can't stop thinkin' about you, (everyday)
It seems my life's worth nothing without you
But everyday I say, ""I'll try to make my heart be still""
'Til then every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday, it gets a little harder
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday, it gets a little harder"
Always,"This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time
That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Always, always"
Love Sneakin' Up On You,"Rainy night, I'm all alone
Sittin here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns
To cold, cold sweat thinkin about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same?
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you
Hey heyyy yea
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin up on your blind side
You might as well
Try to stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be yea
Come on let's finish what you started with me
Yeeaahhh
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you
Heeey yea
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you"
Run-Around,"Oh, once upon a midnight eerie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the thoughts of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies, yeah humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Well, what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down
Shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch"", hey baby, let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down
Tra la la la la bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full, yeah I will drink it and always be full
Oh I like coffee and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?
Oh you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?"
Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?,"To really love a woman

Hold My Hand,"With a little love and some tenderness
We'll walk upon the water
We'll rise above the mess
With a little peace and some harmony
We'll take the world together
We'll take 'em by the hand
'Cause I've got a hand for you
Oh, 'cause I wanna run with you
Yesterday, I saw you standing there
Your head was down, your eyes were red
No comb had touched your hair
I said ""Get up, and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together
Walk the road a while, 'cause""
I've got a hand for you (I've got a hand for you)
I wanna run with you
(Won't you let me run with you babe?)
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
Hold my hand
Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can
See, I was wasted and I was wasting time
'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes
Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems
Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no
'Cause I've got a hand for you (I've got a hand for you)
I wanna run with you
(Ah, won't you let me run with you, babe?)
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the Promised Land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world but
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can, yeah
Let me run, won't you let me run?
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll bring you to a place where you can be
Hold my hand
Anything you wanna be because
I, oh, no, no, no, no, no
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the Promised Land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world but
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can, oh
The best that I can"
Let Her Cry,"She sits alone by a lamp post
Tryin' to find the thought that's escaped her mind
She says, ""Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind""
She never lets me in, only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care, I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away
And just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be
This morning I woke up alone, found a note standing by the phone
Sayin', ""Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday""
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Sayin' let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be
No, no, no, no
Let her cry let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, ah
Last night I tried to leave, cried so much I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'
""Oh, mama, please help me""
Won't you hold my hand and
Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
Ah, let her be"
Strong Enough,"God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot lie
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man
Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave
Don't leave
I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
Just try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man
to be my man?
(Are you strong enough) to be my man?
(Are you strong enough) my man
When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man?
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please, don't leave"
"Colors Of The Wind - End Title - From ""Pocahontas""/Soundtrack Version","You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind"
Only Wanna Be with You,"You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you
You look at me, you've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence
I say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said, I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you
Yeah, I'm tangled up and blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you
Sometimes I wonder if it'll ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you"
December,"Why drink the water from my hand?
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Why follow me to higher ground?
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing
December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out"
You Don't Know How It Feels,"Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
And you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I gotta go
And you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me
My old man was born to rock
He's still trying to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road
There's somewhere I gotta go
And you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me"
All I Wanna Do,"Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me
'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

Can't Stop Lovin' You,"Hah
There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothin's gonna come
Oh no, nothin's gonna change

Oh, could you let it be?

I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made

The World I Know,"Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all the kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on
I drink myself of new found pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why
Are we listening
To hymns of offering?
Have we eyes to see
That love is gathering?
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one, into one
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why, don't know why

1979 - Remastered 2012,"Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see
That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below
The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around"
Time,"Time why you punish me
Like a wave bashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time why you walk away
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow running free
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time
Time I don't understand
Children killing in the street
Dying for the color of red
Time there red and blue
Wash them in the ocean, make them clean
Maybe their mother won't cry tonight
Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow running free
But tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in
Time is wasting time is walking
You ain't no friend of mine
I don't know where I'm goin'
I think I'm out of my mind
Thinking about time
And if I die tomorrow
Just lay me down in sleep
Time is wasting time is walking
You ain't no friend of mine
I don't know where I'm goin'
I think I'm out of my mind
Thinking about time
Time you left me standing there
Like a tree growing all alone
The wind just stripped me bare
Stripped me bare
Time the past has come and gone
The future's far away
And now only lasts for one second, one second
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow, running free
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time
You ain't no friend of mine
I don't know where I'm goin'
I think I'm out of my mind
Walking, wasting
You ain't no friend of mine
And I don't know where I'm goin'
No don't know
Time without courage
And time without fear
Is just wasted, wasted
Wasted time
Time why you punish me"
Wonderwall - Remastered,"Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you

And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
And by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Hook,"It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks
Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely
There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow
Was that Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely
Suck it in suck it in suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin
To see
What you're doing to me this MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So desperately I sing to thee
Of love
Sure but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried well no in fact I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute diddys
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all your cities to the ground
I've found
I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day. Hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because
The Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hoooooook
On that you can rely"
Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First),"In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues
She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what's she doing with him she could be dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah I just want to be
I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin
But I saw you first
On a moon spattered road in her parrot rebozo
Gypsy Scotty is driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
Se whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star
But I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
Yes I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin'
In the bone colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'
The radio is playin, she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that
But I saw you first
I'm the first one tonight
Yes I saw you first
Don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin
But I saw you first

If It Makes You Happy,"I've been long
A long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen
Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
We get down
A real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come proud
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again
Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
We've been far
Far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between
Well, okay, we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?"
Until It Sleeps,"Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now, it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me (yeah)
It hates you so hold me (yeah)
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps (until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me (yeah)
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps (until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps (until it sleeps, until it sleeps)
I don't want it, I don't want it
Want it, want it, no, woah-woah
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til I'm clean
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps, until it sleeps
Until it sleeps, until it sleeps"
Only Wanna Be with You,"You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you
You look at me, you've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence
I say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said, I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you
Yeah, I'm tangled up and blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you
Sometimes I wonder if it'll ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you"
Semi-Charmed Life,"Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make you smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
I said
How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And that four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city, we tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One
And you hold me, and we are broken
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now
Feel myself, heading off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright
And I want something else to get me through this life
Baby, I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Someplace back there, in the place we used to start
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo
I want something else"
Hard To Say I'm Sorry (feat. Peter Cetera),"Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you, baby
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Not for a day, from your body
Baby, I can't live without you, not even for a day
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
And after all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
I can't let go"
When You Love a Woman,"In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searching ain't over and over
I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
(Well) You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines
Waiting somewhere, oh, yeah
If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
Yes I know, I know that
It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walking by
And you look into her eyes
When you love a woman
When you love, love, love, love
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes"
Everyday Is A Winding Road,"I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He says he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there but the brochure looks nice
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low,
These are the days when anything goes
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine
He's got a daughter he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine
I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on coffee and nicotine
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen
Were ever real, were ever really happening
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine"
Change the World,"If I can reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
And I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world
I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world"
Secret Garden,"She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides
She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in herheart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice
You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where You can't remember
And you can't forget
She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"
Go the Distance,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms"
How's It Going to Be,"I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fightin' for
When I say out loud
I want to get out of this
I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion
How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
How's it going to be
How's it going to be"
"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing - From ""Armageddon"" Soundtrack","I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep

Sex And Candy,"Hangin' 'round downtown by myself

Who's that casting devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself

Last Kiss,"Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream, that I heard last
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowin' through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
And now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world"
Fly Away,"I wish that I could fly

Someday,"Someday
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me
One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Some say
Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say
You were always there for me
Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time
And fade away
And fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Someone said you tried too long
Someone said we got it all
Someone said we tried too long
Is there a place where I belong?
So far and so long
So far away
So far and so wrong
So far away, away, away
Some day
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me
One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away

Jumper - 1998 Edit,"I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand
The angry boy
A bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well, everyone I know has got a reason
To say
Put the past away
Wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand
And well, he's on the table
And he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they are doing here
And your friends have left you
You've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I
I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today
We can put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand
I would understand
I would understand
I would understand
Understand
Can you put the past away?
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
And I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

Higher,"When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
So let's go there
Yeah, let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets"

Never Let You Go - 2008 Remaster,"There's every good reason for letting you go
She's sneaky and smoked out
And it's starting to show
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you turn around your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other

Well, maybe I did
But even if I changed
What's wrong with it
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong

Good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
What a good idea
I remember the stupid things, the mood rings, the bracelets and the beads
Nickels and dimes, yours and mine, did you cash in on your dreams?
You don't dream for me, no
You don't dream for me, no
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar from the days in the waves
That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to save
That the girl is like a sunburn
I would like to save

It's Been Awhile,"And it's been awhile

I've stretched myself beyond my means

But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again
Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
And it's been awhile
Since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father

Drive,"Sometimes
I feel the fear of
Uncertainty stinging clear
And I, can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer
It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there, I'll be there
So, if I
Decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of
The hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Aah ah ooo
It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when
I drive myself my light is found
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there
Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there

When It's Over - David Kahne Main,"When it's over

It never ends

Hemorrhage (In My Hands),"Memories are just where you laid them
Drag the waters 'til the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was there something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said
Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away
And leave love bleedin' in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleedin' in my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleedin'
Oh, hold me now, I feel contagious
Am I the only place that you've left to go?
She cries her life is like
Some movie black and white
Dead actors fakin' lines
Over and over and over again she cries
Don't fall away
Leave me to myself
Don't fall away
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding in my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleedin'
And I wanted, you turned away
You don't remember, but I do
Ya never even tried
Don't fall away
Leave me to myself
Don't fall away

Blurry,"Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake

I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?

One Last Breath,"Please come now I think I'm falling

And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say, let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out heaven save me (save me)
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say, let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now

Maybe six feet ain't so far down, I'm so far down
Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me for you and me
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Hold me now

Soak Up The Sun,"My friend, the communist

It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love

Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do

It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"The sun is hot and that old clock
Is movin' slow, and so am I
Work day passes like molasses
In winter time, but it's July
Getting paid by the hour
And older by the minute
My boss just pushed me
Over the limit
I could call him something,
Think I'll just call it a day
Pour me something tall and strong.
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
This lunch break is gonna take
All afternoon, half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
But, hey, that's all right
I ain't had a day off now, in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can just tell them
I just sailed away
Pour me something tall and strong. Make it a big boy drink i don't wanna think
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
And be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care, no i don't care

She Hates Me,"Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued

In a trap, trip I can′t grip
Never thought I'd be the one who′d slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fucking hates me
Trust, she fucking hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
Not feeling bad, no

In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who′d slip
Then I started to realize
I was livin′ one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust, she fuckin′ hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

That's my story as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it′s over, and I'm glad
′Cause I'm a fool for all I've said

She fucking hates me
Trust, she fucking hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust
And she tore my feelings like I had none
She fucking hates me

""She fuckin′ hates me""

Like a Stone,"On a cobweb afternoon
In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
And on my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The wine was bled
And there you led me on
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
Alone
And on I read
Until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wander on
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
Alone"
The First Cut Is The Deepest,"I would have given you all of my heart

Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worse
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try

Mr. Brightside,"Coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

Beverly Hills,"Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little wack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between

It's something that you're born into

No I don't, I'm just a no-class beat-down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Best of You,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holding you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Oh
Oh, ho-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best

Who Says You Can't Go Home,"I spent twenty years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that
But I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
I been all around the world, and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I went as far as I could
I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy
But not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
I been all around the world, and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
I been there, done that, and I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just ten miles up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?"
Chasing Cars,"We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?"
Use Somebody,"I've been roaming around,
Always looking down and all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach

Countless lovers
Undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody

I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

Pumped Up Kicks,"Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, but won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid, yeah

In his dad's closet, and with a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen, and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah""

Knee Deep (feat. Jimmy Buffett),"Gonna put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change you're geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Come on in the water it's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise"

And then she made my lips hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta back track
When everybody talks back

You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itchin'

It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can′t escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don′t get too close, it′s dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It′s where my demons hide"

This is it, the apocalypse

Stressed Out,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh)
To the good old days (oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying
""Wake up, you need to make money"", yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names

Ride,"I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much

On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride
""I'd die for you"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say, when you know it's not true
Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real, like
""Who would you live for?""
""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

Feel It Still,"Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf

Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves

Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the
Kids in the middle, but oh 'til it falls
Won't bother me
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now

Whatever It Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this

Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Hold me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don′t wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box, an epoxy to the world and the vision we′ve lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to remind you that there′s more to see
I′m just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I′ll go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of thee
