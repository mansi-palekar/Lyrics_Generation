(You Gotta ) Fight For Your Right (To Party),"… Kick it!
… You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
You ask you mom, please? but she still says, no
You missed two classes, and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
… You gotta fight for your right to party
… Your pops caught you smoking, and he says, ""No way!""
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (bust it!)
… You gotta fight for your right to party
… You gotta fight
… Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, what's that noise?
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys
… You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party
… Party
Party"
Wild Thing,"Let's do it
Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""
Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please
Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
Wild thing
She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby
Wild thing"
Bust A Move,"This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
Ok, smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move
Ah, ah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Ah, ah, yeah (just bust a move!)
Ah, ah, yeah, ah, ah
You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? hey, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it, (just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""no way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sophistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it (just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it (break it down for me fellas)
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, hey, yeah
Ooh, uh, hey, yeah!
Ooh, uh, hey, yeah!
Ooh, uh, uh, uh
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neato, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feelin really fine 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it, ah
If you want it, baby, you got it (just bust a move), ah
If you want it, you got it, ah
If you want it, baby, you got it (move it, boy)
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Ah, ah, yeah, ah
Aah, hey, aah, yeah!
Aah, aah, heyy, yeah, yeah!"
Funky Cold Medina,"Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
Feel like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def', yo, what's up with L-O-C?
The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""
You know I'm saying
Funky Cold Medina
This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina
Oh, my goodness gracious, break it down for 'em
Uh-huh, Funky Cold Medina
I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink, "" I said, ""Ehm, okay, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't mess around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that your girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina
You know what I'msaying, y'all? Ain't no plans with a man
Oh, yeah, Funky Cold Medina
Oh, it's too late, break it down
Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on, the Love Connection
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for a Medina and some dinner
We had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina
Funky Cold Medina"
Have You Seen Her,"Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in,
I'm just goin' cruise down the road,
Look at the stars in the sky,
And drift off into the sweet memory's that I have,
Of a love that my heart has been searching for,
For so long, and I know somewhere,
If I keep searching, that love I'll find,
The picture grows clearer and clearer,
From the back to the front of my mind,
And like love, a love I know I'll have,
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last,
I see her face and I can't let go,
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,

She's a thought and a vision in my memory,
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love,
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definitely needs,
(please be mine)
Baby be mine,
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it,
So why don't you be mine,
The search is going on,
From coast to coast,
A women for the man, who's propping the most,
(have you seen her?)

(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking,
At the movies, in my car, on my stero,
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up,
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub,
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad,
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need,
(please be mine)
Be mine baby,
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it,
Why don't you be mine,
(baby, be mine)
Where could she be?,
At the store around the corner,
Or wondering at night,
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking,
Calling all my friends all around the place,
Guy, Lavertte, or my homey Rob Base,
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me,
Yo, veo on the phone,
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover,
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother,
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind,
The thought is so clear of the love I need here,
Like D-be magic, and why don't you appear,
(have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear,
I can see yo' face,
I'm seeing her face, again and again,
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in,
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love,
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?,
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ,
(have you seen her? tell me have you seen her? have you seen her?)"
U Can't Touch This,"You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
My, my, my, my
(You can't touch this)
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say ""Oh, my Lord
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet""
It feels good when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
I told you, homeboy
You can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin', and ya know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes, man
You can't touch this
Yo, let me bust the funky Iyrics
You can't touch this
Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that
Now you know you wanna dance
So, move outta your seat
And get a fly girl
And catch this beat
While it's rolling
Hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
Yo, I told you
You can't touch this
Why you standing there, man?
You can't touch this
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucker
You can't touch this
Give me a song or rhythm
Making them sweat, that's what I'm giving them
Now, they know
You talk about the Hammer
When you're talkin 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin'
So pass them a wipe or a tape
To learn
What it's gonna take in the 90's to burn
The chart's legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word, because, you know
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!
Stop, Hammer time!
""Go with the flow"", it is said
If you can't groove to this, then you probably are dead
So, wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Now move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)
Yeah
You can't touch this
Look, man
You can't touch this
You'll probably get hyped, boy, 'cause you know you can't
You can't touch this
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!
Stop, Hammer time!
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!
Stop, Hammer time!
Every time you see me
That Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic
Now, why would I ever
Stop doing this
With others making records
That just don't hit?
I toured around the world
From London to The Bay
It's ""Hammer! Go, Hammer! MC Hammer! Yo, Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
""U Can't Touch This""
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah
You can't touch this
I told you
You can't touch this
Too hype, you can't touch this
Yo, we're outta here
You can't touch this"
The Humpty Dance,"All right, stop whatcha doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny, but, yo, I'm makin' money, see
So, yo, world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather 'round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty
Yo, ladies, oh, how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten
Please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Uh, yo fat girl, come here, are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom, I'm crazy
Allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump

That's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, be
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump

A-doo-doo, a-doo-doo
Oh, yeah
Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy, whack, funky
People say, ""You look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty""
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
You got it down when you appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin'
Jig around, shakin' ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
(Oh, do me, baby) everybody, uh
Do the Humpty Hump, come on, do the Humpty Hump

Keep on doin' the Humpty Dance

Peace and humptiness forever"
Just a Friend,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and gues who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?""
She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man, "" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again
I said, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that
Jus' bust this
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I as on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I say
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend"
Around The Way Girl,"You got me shook up, shook down, shook out
On your loving, on your loving
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in them
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (To the bridge)
I need an around the way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for whining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him (You got me shook)
I need an around the way girl

Move her like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we did school and I schooled her

O.P.P,"Army with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em
OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P... well... that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (All the homies)
As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something
Different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it... ah... sorta properly
I say the last P... hmmm... stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
Exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (Every last lady)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (All the ladies)
This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's
That
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), who's down with OPP (This whole party)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me), you down with OPP (Yeah you know me)

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

And you want a triple X throwdown

Tennessee,"Lord, I've really been real stressed, down and out, losing ground
Although I am black and proud, problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up, why does it have to be so damn tuff?
I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire
(Home!) But Lord, I ask you
(Home!) to be my guiding force and truth
(Home!) For some strange reason it had to be
(Home!) he guided me to Tennessee
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg and Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climb the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (Home)
Go back, from whence you came (Home)
My family tree, my family name (Home)
For some strange reason it had to be (Home)
He guided me to Tennessee (Home)
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games
I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Take me to another place, take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan
Oh, won't you let me, won't you help me
won't you help me understand your plan
Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place
Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place"

People Everyday - Metamorphosis Mix,"People
Right about this time, stay loose
Cool, chilled licks by one called, Arrested Development
Say, come on, selectah, easy
See, I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right?
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation, maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored 'em 'cause, see, I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hairdo
And the loud bright colors that I wear
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing, brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me! See?
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people
I told the niggas, ""Please let us pass, friend""
I said ""Please"", 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before, I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see
I am everyday people (everyday, yeah)
You see, I am everyday people
The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you step into
'Cause you might get killed, or shot, and it's not worth it
Africans need to be loving each other, and unite"

The jibbedy-jabber jaw ja-jabbing at your funny bone, um
Skip the ovaltine, I'd rather have a honeycomb
Or preferably the sesame, let's spiggedy-spark the blunts, um
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
Snap a neck for some live efx
Well I'll be darned, shiver me timbers, yo head for the hills
I picked a weeping willow, and a daffodil
So back up bucko or I'll pulverize mcgruff
'Cause this little piggy gets busy and stuff
Arrivederci, heavens to mercy, honky tonk I get swift
I caught a snuffleufagus and smoked a boogaloo spliff
I got the nooks, the cranies, the nitty gritty fodey-doe
All aboard, cast away, hey where's my boogaloo?
Oh I'm steaming, agony
Why's everybody always picking on me
They call me puddin' tane, and rap's my game
You ask me again and I'll t-tell you the same
'Cause I'm the vulgar vegemintarian, so stick 'em up freeze
So no pork sausages, mom, please
A-blitz shoots the breeze, twiddly-dee shoots his lip
Crazy dazy shot the sheriff, yup and I shot the gift
And that's pretty sneaky, sis oh yep
I got my socks off, my rocks off, my nestle's cup of cocoa
Holly hobby tried to slob me, tried to rob me silly stunt
Diggedy-dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
Snap a neck for some live efx
Yahoo, hidee-ho yup I'm coming around the stretch
So here fido boy, fetch, boy, fetch

And I'm the hickory-dickory top of morning boogoloo big jaw
With the yippedy zippedy winnie the pooh bad boy blue
Yo crazy got the gusto, what up, I swing that too
So nincompoop give a hoot and stomp a troop without a strain
Like roscoe b. coltrane
I spiggedy-spark a spiff and give a twist like chubby checker
I take my froot loops with two scoops, make it double decker
Oh vince, the baby come to papa duke
A babaloo, ooh, a babaloo boogedy boo
I went from gucci to stussy, to fliggedy-flam a groupie
To zsa zsa, to yibbedy-yabba dabba hoochie koochie
Tally ho i-i'll take my stove top instead of potatoes, so
Maybe I'll shoot 'em now, nope maybe I'll shoot 'em later, yep
I used to have a dog and bingo was his name oh, so uh

Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
They want efx, some live efx
Snap a neck for some live efx"
Mr. Wendal,"Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal, yeah
Lord, Mr. Wendal"
Boom! Shake the Room,"Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom!
Mercy mercy, mercy me
My life is a cage but on stage I'm free

It Was A Good Day,"Break 'em!
Shit!
Yo! Yeah!
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally, got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do'
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24'?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe, today was a good day, shit!
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from them cowards
'Cause just yesterday, them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police, and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em!
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas, and watch me break 'em
Wit' the seven, 7-11, 7-11
Seven, even back do' Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day, shit!
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on her big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp!"" (yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home, and my pager's still blowin' up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day, shit!
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?"
Alright (feat. Super Cat),"The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright
Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.
Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do
Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind

Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside
Without livin' in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'

I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang

You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
'Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself

Still tryin' to get a peace of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same 'cause the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange? Ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work, then you don't eat
And only down-ass niggas can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop the five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart, son, if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low

Keep Ya Head Up,"Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block, brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (you don't need him)
You know me makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothas make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? (Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women (why? Why? Why? Why?)
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies (oh, yeah, baby)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter (ohh)
Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
Keep-keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right (oh, yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (no, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em (left you all by yourself)
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up"

"Flava in Ya Ear Remix (feat. Notorious B.I.G., L.L. Cool J, Busta Rhymes, Rampage)","… Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint
… Just like Uniblab, robotic kickin' flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter (body into anti-matter)
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between (take 'em down, Mack)
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand (take 'em down, Mack)
Now, hold up, let's make this official (make it official)
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue (wake 'em up)
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kickin' out more harder than a diamond (harder than a diamond)
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say, ""Craig Mack, "" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear
… Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (brand new flava in ya ear)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
… Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burnin', beggin' please
Brother, freeze, this man's undisputed
In deep rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tastin' MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue to think that you could outdo
My one-two that's sick like the flu (shake 'em down, Mack)
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time (ha)
'Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position (knock 'em out)
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, makin' cement crack (make it crack)
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
… Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (here comes the brand new flava in ya ear, boy)
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (flava in ya ear, boy)
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
… Ha, the Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down breakin' forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat (what? huh?)
Gettin' hotter than the sun get (yeah)
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet (boy)
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherriff that's in town
Is gettin' down, leavin' bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and
… Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear (flava in ya ear)
Time for new flava in ya ear (flava)
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear (here comes the Mack)

Got Me Waiting,"Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love
I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kinda digging me
But every time you see me
You seem to be ignoring me
I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me
But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
I'll catch you the next day
When I focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you
I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low profile type
I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama
What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one
I want to know cause if I don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm standing, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from
The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
Yeah, and I want some
So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A rubber to get got
I'm not your man
But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me
I gotta hear it from you, girl, sometime
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the boogie down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me
I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet
Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love
Hey, yo, hey, yo
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
I never stumble cause I mumble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped
But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
It was your trip
Scared a grip
Because I'm losing it
I did what's clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it
I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already
But I'm-a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide
Let me know cause if you don't
It's gonna haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
Really, really want to know you
You got me thinking

Hey you! Sittin' over there (say what?)
You better get up out of your chair (that's right)
And work your body down (yeah)
No time to funk around, 'cause we gon'
Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
One, two for the crew, three, four for the dough
Five for the hoes (hoes) six, seven, eight for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I'm fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'ma kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro, so
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring, ding, dong
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Yeah, uh, come on
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I can see you
You can't see me
Yeah
Death Row, let me know you in the house (biatch!)
Yeah, that's right, we out"
I Wish,"Hey, this is radio station W S K E E
We're takin' calls on the wish line
Making all your wacky wishes come true
Hello
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go and even in my dreams
I can scheme a way to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all, I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle
And I been in the hospital
For talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin' in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick, quick got sick, sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right? So when I asked her out she said, I wasn't her type
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat
But that's flat and do you really wanna know
What's really whack, see I can't even get a date
So, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really tho' I 'm a figaro
When I'm in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well, then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
'Cause it's hard to survive when your livin'
In a concrete jungle
And these girls just keep passin' me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say my, my, my
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a baller
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause everyday would be a Friday
You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie, big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should notice how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like dat
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish, I wish, I wish"
Feel Me Flow,"You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
lyrically splitting dismissing
I'm on a mission of just hitting
now it's written and kitten hitting wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixin's that ain't fitting to be hitting.
On nothing splitting things that's bitten
And getting written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye.
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that's on point like
Decimals manhandling new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew
Looking for the pink in poo poo.
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jamming ta while we planning ta jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managing damaging mics
Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I want to know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertibrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breaking to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we want to know is if your body want to party
It's 'nough poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up.
Shakes shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like your with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty.
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
So here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow"

Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me
God bless you workin' on a plan to heaven
Follow the lord all twenty-four-seven days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keepin' me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I'm guessin' my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Oh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

Loungin (Who Do Ya Luv) - Remix,"Mmh, go ahead daddy
It's a Queens thing baby
Who do you love?
Trackmasters, rock on
Who do you love?
(We be doing it now)
Baby, close, rock on
Who do you love?
Are you for sure? (The remix)
How you doin miss? My name is L I'm from Queens
I heard about your man he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin' love, Duke is weak then he fallin' asleep
You on the phone with your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Jew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style
He ain't watchin' you he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'ma turn that a- out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that a-
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You gotta try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand then it's bye-bye love
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love?
Are you for sure?
Who do you love?
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
So what you got the cash flow and escro, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down now you Nino Brown
Rock roller wit' so much ice your cap's polar
I got em smokin' beanies, modelin' bikinis
Pushin' ya whip on the freeway to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teachin' shorty all the tools that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, gettin' money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge wit' you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)
Who do you love?
Are you for sure?
Who do you love?
Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)
Who do you love? (Trackmasters rock on)
Who do you love? (Uncle Al rock on)
Who do you love?
Who do you love?"

Mmm, you make me wild, don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?
Nice and wet
We get it on To The Break of Dawn, damn you're large
How a big girl like it daddy?
Nice and hard
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' that affectionate
Chewin' it, viewin' it, all while we're doin' it
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn"

It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mack
Still slackin back-packin up my turf
Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst
Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's
But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)
Me and Daddy for the big picture
Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister
I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome
I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone
I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around
And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now
No hesitation I hops to it

Let em all know that my moms is gone
And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home
Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more
I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door
Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody
True that, so homies don't bring your main misses
Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's
And this could be your very last time seein her
One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her
So come alone or don't come at all (why?)
Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball
True it's, usually not represented right
But with me it's all to the g and tonight's the night

"Keep On, Keepin' On (feat. Xscape)","B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can, if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?
You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body, who's body? You're body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leavin' time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right
Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah
Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to goin' home at night
Brother does mo right, under the candlelight
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can, can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can, can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling 69 ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. or an Ice
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company
Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah
Many have tried strict regulation
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me
You better work me, while you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L Y T E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell, only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame
Get the name, and kick the game"

"Not Tonight (feat. Da Brat, Left Eye, Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott and Angie Martinez) - Remix","come on
JM yo, come on
JM yo, huh
JM yo, all so, so dark, come on
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Nighttime pissy drunk off the Henny and Remmy
I didn't mind it (uh-huh) when he fucked me from behind (what?)
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back, go fuck with some other cats""
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin' ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice (woo)
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' the mic (come on)
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that could have made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy (huh, say what?)
I don't want dick tonight (come on, come on)
Eat my pussy right (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Little Kim, Little Kim, bring it to me now
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag, so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear, he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was whack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double blast (I like that)
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me (come on)
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones (it's JM yo)
I'll give you ten Gs nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight (yeah, yeah)
Eat my pussy right (uh-huh)
The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit 'til they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends (that's right)
Me and my girls rock worlds, and big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I can be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front (uh-huh)
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they really
Suck my pussy 'til they kill me, you feel me? (uh) (yeah)
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
(Say what? Come on, uh)
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right (uh, JM yo)
I don't want dick tonight (it's JM yo)
Eat my pussy right (Junior M.A.F.I.A, uh)
(It's JM yo)
I don't want dick tonight (JM yo)
Eat my pussy right (come on, huh)
I don't want dick tonight (I like that, come on)
Eat my pussy right (JM yo)
I don't want dick tonight (yeah)
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight"

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)
Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me, homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to hell, 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bullet holes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago
And that's just like a nigga want to take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't want to say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder motherfuckers in a deadly way
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most, I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga want to test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin'
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas want to roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen, God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember, eternal, it means for everlastin'
Number one assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes?)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see?)
I see five killer realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killers, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double time
And it's like that, you won't get
Come and get some pap, pap
Want to sound like?
Want to be like? Nigga, we can't have
Why a nigga want to bite the bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the forty four mag, I'm glad
'Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a body bag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with

Cold Rock a Party,"To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
To the L, to the Y, and the T, to the E
Rock a party and rock a party and rock a
Party int the B- girl stance."
C U When U Get There (feat. 40 thevz),"Yeah, it's a hit
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending that you're low-keybut you're broke and
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the homies heard about it
They thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy?
'Cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother can never by replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya
I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dustas
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryna preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there (yo, what up, huh?)
(You know Ghost had to jump)
(On the unplugged version with you) if you ever get there
(Rest in peace, Michael Jackson) see you when you get there
Hmm, check it
Stressed by this game of life, I can't lie
Sometimes I sit at home and contemplate suicide
But Lord knows, this nigga don't wanna die
I find myself with clenched fists lookin' towards the sky
Question God, ""Why?"" With a tear from my eye
""Does anybody really care if I'll ever die?""
Do I have friends or all of y'all fake?
When I'm rollin', are they done or is it my money to take?
I wanna leave it all just to 'scape from this cold world
But I'm not quite ready to fall
Time's moving too fast and it seems like it's too late
No friends at my funeral, no friends at my wake
They hatin' on my niggas 'cause we hussle for our papers
You gotta live your life and do it for your every day
They try to hate my race for the colour of our skin
While I hussle, sell dope, and take care of my kid
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
Okay now, here's the situation
I raised in a racist nation and then given an inferior education
A respresentation as in a tow-up area of the inner city
Where life is iffy, and average self-esteem is itty-bitty
But we're lookin' for no pity, you can miss me
Go ahead and talk, but if you diss me they gon' have to come and get me
They wanna bend me for my city, acting like they down
But they against me, they tempt me to touch either shoe 'til it's empty
They take my child into penitentiary, they'll touchdown for a century
They're grillin' me, you feelin' me?
That's why I'm waitin' in the bushes
Now for those that are responsible, the villa wouldn't all push it
Put yourself in my position, would you go on or would you listen?
Under these conditions, get bold 'til somebody's comin' up messin'?
When the lights come on, we run words or mice, so be prepared
I hope you ain't scared
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there"
I Shot The Sheriff,"--Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--
I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in
--Chorus--
They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you want to pull me over?
'cause I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats
then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in
--Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
'cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but that's okay
'cause I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in"

Try and live it up
Ride true, a bigger truck
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?
Jig with it, cuz, ship crisp, split it all
- Ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your -
Lighting up drugs, always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, b- in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end

And I deal with - that pose in Maybelline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at y'all

With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ass cat

Kiss His feet for freedom
Tell 'em thank you Lord

I ain't chillin' 'til I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island , forget about wildin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'

None of this, six-gunnin' this, brother runnin' this
Buffalo soldier, look, it's like I told ya

Be outta that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
… Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, runnin' the game
James West, tamin' the West, so remember the name

Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all that riffin' ya did
Front and center, now where your lip at kid?

Lookin' damn good, though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryna hear that

When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me, son, I'm the slickest they is

So if you barkin' up the wrong tree, we comin'

The Real Slim Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ah)
It's the return of the ""ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who""
""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ah)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""how can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"

Ms. Jackson,"Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin' fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times"

Superwoman Pt. II - Rap Version Remix,"I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle round
I found a superwoman that can leap from the truck in a single bound
Mammie, I'm tryna bling you down
So niggas without shades on can't stare when I bring you round
She put her lips on the weed and pull it
Then work her tongue and me cum faster than a speeding bullet
Her love's stronger than a locomotive
But only for the f-a-b-o-l-o-u-s
Sing to me ma
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman
They don't know any girls like me no no
Take a girl like me to get a guy like you to understand
How girls and guys sing
I'm not your average chic
'Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman
Boy I told you once before
You ain't gotta look up in the sky
'Cause the girl you need is right before your eyes
Your so sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothing to stand for
'Cause with me you won't fall off no baby ooh
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman
Everyday, everyday
I'll love you in a special way
They can't stay
Now that I'm here, I'm here
It's superwoman 'bout to save my day
Them co's I hooked and gave some play
Now I wouldn't even wave their way
I understand why them other chics behave that way
They see the icy S on your chest engraved in grey
Be hipped I might
You usually get my tips I'm tight
The only green I keep from you in kryptonite
When that blowing red suit hits your hips so right
It's like de de de de, de de de de de de damn
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin you is a crime
They gon have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From lairs to CL's to my share of the females but
You know I care for you (care for me)
And anytime this nigga's there for you (there for me)
These feelings I only share for you
This makes it a lil mo clear for you that
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman
Baby they can't play you
'Cause I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your super woman"

Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in yo' mind punk so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet, that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm an all nighter, shoot all fire

I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance be a man, take my hand understand

Ain't It Funny (feat. Ja Rule & Cadillac Tah) - Murder Remix,"Estoy loca
Enamorada, de ti
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (oh)
And you can't move on even though you try (oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be
Oh
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right, no no
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try (though you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel (baby)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it's strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part"
"I Need a Girl (Pt. 2) [feat. Loon, Ginuwine & Mario Winans]","Yeah, come on
I need a, I want a...
I need a girl, to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl, to make my wife
I need a girl, who's mine, all mine
I need a girl, in my life
Yo, I'm Internationally known, on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife, at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone, but
Chicks that romance, don't tickle my fancy
Boning, Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
Need a girl, that can stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to DeLancy, to trips to the Grammy's, cause
Most of these girls, be confusing me, I don't know, if they really love me
Or they using me, maybe it's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed, and now, you abusin' me
That's why, I need me a girl, that be true to me
Know bout' the game, and know how it do to me
Without a girl, on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl it's you and me, now let's ride!

Nobody else, she's all mine
I need a girl, in my life
Yo, yo, I done met a lot of women, in my lifetime
But see, it's not a lot of women, that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks, wit' all the right features
And hood-rat chicks, that only rock sneakers
Cell-phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya'
You break her heart, she'll walk out, and leave ya'
I find a girl, I'm a keep her, cause know I'm getting money
And the game getting deeper, yo' on some real shit
I need somebody, I can chill wit', I need somebody, I can build wit'
I need somebody, I can hold tight, wintertime, and the full-length's
Snow-white, anytime, we together, feels so right

At first, we were friends, then became lovers (Oh')
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers (Oh')
All night, we would play fight, undercovers

And how we used to drive, the whole city wild (Oh', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Damn, I wish you would've, had my child, a pretty little girl
Wit' Diddy style (girl, you mean that much, to me)
This shit is wild, all them days, that I reminsce

Oops (Oh My) [feat. Missy Elliott],"Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From this body, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like lines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?
I looked over to the left
Mmm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself
I looked over to the left
Mmm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself
I looked over to the left
Mmm I was eyein' my thighs butter pecan brown
I looked over to the left
Mmm comin outta my shirt and then the skirt came down
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?"
Addictive,"He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin', spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
Oh! tonight he's waitin', and I ain't complainin'
I'm entertainin', my number one fan
My back is achin', from our love makin'
Oh yes I'm takin', ain't no use in fakin'
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin', spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
Thinkin' of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c-notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin' in tongues
Breathin' hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin' loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin', spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin', spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady"
Cleanin' Out My Closet,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo
Yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me
But they never figure me out
Look at me now
I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama?
Imma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ah
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby
Maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split
I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't owe him a second thought
I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie
And I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim
I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her, at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid
No doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em
Shit, I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life
I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem Show
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position
Just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what?
You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now
You should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her
She won't even be at your funeral
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what?
I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet"

Minute Man, Big Red can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask you
When I come out, you won't even matter
Why you act dumb like ugh, duh
So you act dumb like ugh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum, pa-pom-pom
Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabon (Come on)
Is it worth it? Let me work it

To my fellas (Ooh, good god)
I like the way you work that
To my ladies (Woo)

"Lose Yourself - From ""8 Mile"" Soundtrack","Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's knows is grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum, da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man"
Rainy Dayz,"Some come around me tryna call my bluff
Pushin' my buttons just to see if I'm tough
Behind my back spreadin' all kind of lies
'Cause your an agent workin' on both sides
Hangin' around me tryna get some shine
You're mad at me because I work for mine
Plus sweat and tears just to make a dime
While you sit back and try to take what's mine
Don't let 'em push you to the limit 'cause they like it a lot
And if they're not with you then tell 'em to just-
Keep it movin' (Keep it movin'), keep it movin' (Keep it movin'), yeah
'Cause you ain't even got no business hatin' on me
And I'm sorry that you feel this way but you can just-
Keep it movin' (Keep it movin'), keep it movin', oh yeah
Spiritually, mentally, physically
I'm tryin' my best to better myself and no one else
But you're so busy thinkin' that this money is gonna turn me
To someone else and settle for less
Get your own life, on your own time, stop hangin' around
Tryna drain me dry
I've been broke before, I can't do it no more, but if I have to
It won't be over you
No one in this world can make me self-destruct
If you listen real close you would hear
Just what I'm tryin' to say to you, you and your crew
So stop sittin' 'round waitin' on me to lose
Don't let 'em push you to the limit 'cause they like it a lot

The Whole World (feat. Killer Mike),"Okay, here we go
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song
And I want y'all to sing along, sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside
And you're, all alone, all alone, yeah
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward, not behind then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought, he could rhyme
If his momma is a quarter
Daughter must be a dime, I gotta meet her
Don't take no shorts, I don't use abbreviation
I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
No, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport
Who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin' like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gatherin' no moss
Mami, I'm comin', I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac, OutKast just won't stop
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom, medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now, even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wishlist
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's persuable
Doing God's willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself
Dre set it on the right and I'll set it on the left 'cause
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues

I don't round that many girls cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home cause I'm next to ya

See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized
Mira (So can I get your number?)
Mi amor me ama bien
Te encantara si quisieras lo tendras
(I don't know what you said, but I like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada
Lo que que me hayo me consigo
Y morena, ojos negros
Y sonrisa soleada
Everywhere I go I'm spotted
And everything I want I got it
5'5 with brown eyes
Smile like the sunrise
Everywhere I go I'm spotted

Luv U Better,"This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore
This is hard to say
I want to make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct
Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know
Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always

When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do

God willin' we gon' die together
It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise
Baby smile today

We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short, how much longer can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now
Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it?
We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the God feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

To talk the truth to you

I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to 50 cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (Oh yeah)
Word is bond, never screw none of these industry cats (Boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Yes you know I'll die for you
And you know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you
I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back ma, I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you

Can't Let You Go (feat. Mike Shorey & Lil' Mo),"Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
Shes my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup aint playin right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like im gassin ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonderin why he comin home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if ya'll bump heads it'll be a fight
But i said it'll be alright

Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I live and grown?
But I can't let ya go
You aint ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So i made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, i'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But i know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So i cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you aint too shy to do them freaky things
I aint gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin the whole world im your new allen springer
At first you were somethin i denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin in the ride
But shorty
Theres something that you provide
Cause the entre pain is good without somethin on the side
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I live and grown?
But i can't let ya go
Your the one i want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I live and grown?
But I can't let ya go
Uh oh, i might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if im a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R Kelly
You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings im'ma share wit you

On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you

Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent

You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(Baby, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (My sweet baby)
And you're my baby (Holla if you hear me)
Oooh-ooh-ooh
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thing

But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan

Babycakes, you motherfucker, you sons of bitches
Ain't none of these niggas real like us
Ya underdig?
And yes sir, we here to stay
Right now
Let's get into this motherfucker
Ya understand?"
"Lose Yourself - From ""8 Mile"" Soundtrack","Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's knows is grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum, da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

03' Bonnie & Clyde,"Uh, uh, uh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em
Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) (that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) (look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no beatch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) (that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend) (look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (that's right!)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (one more time!)
It's on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend) (that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)"

Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

Jenny from the Block - Track Masters Remix featuring Styles P. & Jadakiss,"Children growing, women producing
Men go work, and some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
L O X yeah, JLo
Yea, yea, yo, yo
We off the blocks this year, went from a 'lil to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yea we're at the airport out
D-Glock from the block where everybody air-forced out
With a new white tee you fresh, nothin' phoney with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
From ""In Livin' Color"" to movie scripts
To ""On the 6"" to ""J.Lo"" to this, headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya, I'm really been on Oprah, that's just me
Nothin' phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
I'm down to earth like this, rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and lovin' it, rumors got me laughin' kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing, yeah
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
Yo, it take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, they're assets
You get back what you put out
If even if you take the good route, can't count the hood out
After a while you'll know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones you came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and JLo
(Everyone's got to make a livin')
They act like they don't, but they know, yeah
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx

Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from, from the Bronx

Can't Hold Us Down (feat. Lil' Kim),"So, what, am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (so, so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world (around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth (woah)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (woah)
So what do we do, girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (stand our ground)
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud (woah)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (woah)
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (woah)
Nobody can hold us down (hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (hold us down)
Never can, never will
So, what, am I not supposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
'Cause you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginnin' for us, everybody sing
This is for my girls all around the world ('round the world) (yeah)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth (respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (you can't get rid of us)
So what do we do, girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (we standin' our ground on this one)
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud (woah)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (check it)
Here's somethin' I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head and sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the table's 'bout to turn, I'll bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down (oh no)
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back
You're just a little boy
You think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
This is for my girls, oh
This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth (respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do, girls? Shout louder (shout louder)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (we stand our ground)
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud (oh, ooh-ooh)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (oh-ooh)
This is for my girls all around the world (for my girls)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth (around the world)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (yeah)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (stand our ground)
So lift your hands higher and wave 'em proud (woah)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down
Uh, oh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Spread the word
Can't hold us down
Yeah, we here, we back again
Yeah, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera
Yeah

Love Of My Life (An Ode To Hip Hop) - Longer Album Version,"Right here what we gonna do is go back
Way back
Ooh...
Way back, yeah
I met him when I was a
A little girl, he gave
He gave me poetry
And he was my first
But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up
Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the
Love of my life
You are my friend (yea)
Love of my life
I can depend
Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like I sampled true love
But the shit didn't clear
A freak-freak, y'all, and ya don't stop
To the beat y'all and ya don't stop
A freak-freak
How could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teen age lover who said
He's just a friend
He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but
Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the
Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Without you, baby
Feels like I sampled true love, yeah
But the shit didn't clear
Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back I had to sweat her
Thought she roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow I had to let her (Never)
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Lookin' for cheese, that don't make her a hood rat(rat)

Ooh, you know you rock my world and(Love of my life)

Thugz Mansion - 2Pac Original/Acoustic,"Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would of tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Children, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy.
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy."

Hey"
I Want You,"No one else can ever
No one else can ever
No one else can ever
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
What did I
Do to deserve such a man so special in my life
So many days and nights
I get on the go while I sit and wait for mister right
Baby, then came you
Laid back with your sexy smile
When you move your body you just drive me wild
If you're feeling me, baby, tell me now
Because I want you, I want you
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the
keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Can't you see
How this love affair would be good for you and me
'Cause baby, I swear no other man can do
The things that you do when you love me
Oh, baby, you're my lifetime fantasy
So smooth, love the way you walk
I just love to hear when you talk your talk
So if you're feeling me, baby, let me know
Because I want you, I want you
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the
Keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you, babe
Slow down, love
Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was
I know you're used to seein? me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin? Cris?, just a million in
dubs
But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
'Cause I don't want to be a player no more
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you
Baby...baby...baby...baby...
Baby...baby...baby...baby..."
Lean Back,"I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens nigga
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty with the logo kid!
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See Money Ain't a Thing nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt ya
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up!
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship, come on!
Niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back"

It was weird how we met, huh
She was with her mom at Bank of America
With my son cashing a check so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, Mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks threw the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff Dropped her off and told her call me up
(Ring noise)
We could talk, conversate about the lyric subject whatevers starts
So I zoomed off (car noise)
Looking bottom off my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away

Yo yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin off, tryin to dunk, tryin to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong on looked at her and I said
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away

I'm only one call away
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul

Watchin' you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screamin', ""My, my, my, my!""
Walk on the carpet, with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kickin' it on the couch at 106 & Park

I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (we gon' set this party off right)
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
Oh, when it all, it all falls down (uh)
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down
And when it falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
I say, ""Fuck the police, "" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all (yeah, c'mon, c'mon)

I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)

Oh, when it all (Chi-Town, Chi-Town)
It all falls down (We gon' show 'em how we get down)

It all falls down (you saved my life, c'mon)

When it's over, I wanna creep off wit you
Get you in my house and dig off with you
Word on the streets that it bites like a Jada
I already know it shakes like a salt shaker
Shawty crunk, on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy ocean
Roll, like a 18 wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine, but this ho a killa
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby, when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker
Tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker
Tremble like a vibrator
Girl just shake it, don't break it
It took your momma nine months to make it
That ass will make me more money than ice did Jacob
With an ass like that, who cares you're an A cup
Now drop it, take it to the floor, bring it back then stop her
Make it bounce, make it shake, make it clappa
Now move that ass like an ounce of crack, quick and fast
Ass so fat it's in the future and the past
She rides dick 'til it breaks, leave it in a cast
But you're not to keep it to yourself
Don't you dare leave it in the ass, oh no
I call her Miss VA, 'cause of the way she makes that thing Go Go
But you ain't a ho doe, mami I know
Same old story, here we go
Yes and no, mami let me know
But for now shake it like a salt shaker, den get low
Shawty crunk, on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy ocean
Roll, like a 18 wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine, but this ho a killa
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby, when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker
Tremble like a vibrator
Shake it like a salt shaker
Tremble like a vibrator
I got ya bitch pussy poppin' in her pants
The beat got her ass in a trance
Holdin' up her goddamn hands
Like I dunno why I wanna dance
But she shook-it, shook-it, shake-it every time she get a chance now
In the booty club, is the place to be
But the bitch so crunk, she'll shake for free
Got her up, get her crunk, that's what you gon' see
Bald head, pink popper dat punani
Money ain't a thang, I'm damn sure glad I came
Butt naked bitches gettin' off da chain
Bouncin' dat ass, like she ridin' a dick
Here's a ten, twenty, keep dancin' bitch
'Cause I like the way you shake dat shit
Me and my brother in dis bitch, show a nigga whatchu workin' wit
I see ho's, ho's, and mo ho's
And none of these bitches, got on some clothes
Shawty crunk, on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy ocean
Roll, like a 18 wheeler (whomp whomp)
That ho fine, but this ho a killa
Ho's be drunk on it, pop
Let me see ya shake it baby, when you do the walk on it
Shake it like a salt shaker

Shake it like a salt shaker
Tremble like a vibrator"

Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
Twenty six inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm eightys man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
I'm only twenty one, sitting on mills
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire

If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her ??
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to cum when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader
We on fire

When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shawty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said, ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

My Band,"I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him""
""Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem""
""I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock""
""Please, Marshall, please let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band, my band, my band, my band
My band, my band, my band, my band
My band
Alright, okay, alright
Give me the mic, man
Okay, come on, man
You need to give me this mic (ah, yeah)
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back
Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up, and his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em, you got somethin' to say? Man, nothin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, what's up?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up, and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aw, man, whatever, I swear, man
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo it's-) ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he gettin' ninety and we only get ten percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag, bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
Goddamn it, I'm sick of this group (fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up (uh)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name (man, fuck this)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (fuck Marshall)
'Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the new lead-
My band, my band (your band)
My band, my band (our band, your band)
My band, my band (you man, you man)
My band, my band, my band (Roxanne Shante, you lesbian)
Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world, D12
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, whoa
Look out for my next single, it's called, ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?"
Through The Wire,"Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they, Hop?
I spit it through the wire, man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town, what's going on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her, her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been tryna be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use me tryna be lying
I've been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I used two lifelines?
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the making, man
I really apologize for everything right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks
You know we had reconstru-
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah
Uh
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill
Got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking 'bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
'Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid s- that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
You know what I'm saying?
When the doctor told me I had a, um
I was goin' to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on""
You can't be serious, man"

Wanna Get To Know You,"I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna f- you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swinging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that a-, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go sm- some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (What?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home, I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna f- you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special, I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my on-ly
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your ho-mie
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy (Yeah)
Don't know what f- me up more, watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a ni- to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (Wooo!)
Big house, big Benz, girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, f- what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna f- you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna be your lover (Oh yeah)
I wanna understand you, baby
I wanna be your lover
I wanna understand you, baby"

Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 2-7 need a natural graze road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' he glistening""
I ain't come to talk (talk) I ain't come to sit (sit)

Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, and silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island

(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Every day's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we've got you on tape""
Yelling an old lady to touch my body
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit, yo, you signed me up to battle?

Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezing, it's the season

When you make it go 'round and 'round
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you with?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah, that's my clique

On the dancefloor a nigga doin' old moves

Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch

Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit
This is 50, comin' out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though 'cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low 'cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She must, ta heard, about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like, ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit

Gangstas don't know how to act
Adamsville, Bankhead, College Park, Carver Homes

'Cause we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum? I'm who you should get, get, get, get, get
Ludacris on the track, get back, trick
Switch on the 'Lac, I'm flexin' still

Could care less about your genius
I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steel
Trunk-rattlin' what's happenin', huh?
I don't even think I need the speed
Bass-travelin', face-cracklin' huh?

Hate It Or Love It,"Yeah, let's take 'em back, uh-huh
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope for a four finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em
Kill a nigga on my song and really do it
That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride and if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on, see how time fly?
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top

Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted, I think
What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

Lovers And Friends,"You know baby I spent a lot of time running away from love

Similar to Mike Jones
Say my name enough then I'm takin' you home
You know I walk when I talk when I sleep with the girl
One squeeze and you gone

Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention

Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more they chest
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks
I had sad beginnings when I rap wit no fans
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago

Look like he been swimming in shoulder height water

If you smell like you been at work all day and your car

Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body
Please say put yo hands down
If yo spinning rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancing on the dance floor and you look to yo left and yo right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin', if your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't Order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
Put your hands down, now look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok
You see the nigga with the white socks, not pimpin'!
Sorry unless your part of the Beat It entourage, if your shoes have a buckle
On, your not pimping"
Mockingbird,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of them were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money
For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you can go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work
You and mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone
Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like your sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are
And daddy's still here
Lainie I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise
Mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdy's neck
I'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
Don't fuck with dad, haha"

TIP coming live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State want to see my need
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Another nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club strippers give neck 'fore I sit down
Still balling money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doing shows putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town
I got the crowd yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hot girls yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this

You be rapping bout blow I was moving the shit
You talking bout shooting out and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face you goin' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know I'm true to be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine
I got the crowd yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you want to beef wit the king what is you goin' do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hitting the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nuts too large and we way too fresh

Everybody's on the floor
Goin', goin' outta control
Set it off from your left dawg
Set it off from your right dawg
Set it off, nigga I said set if off (Set, set, set if off)
Sick with it boy, better get with it, what?
In the club, I get it goin', goin', uh

To the sound of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right, aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do
Hit the dance floor, move how you wanna move
Later on, we can cruise if you wanna cruise
It's whatever you want, the fact is, I got more than I flaunt (Yeah)
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor, jam-packed, look

Set it off from your left dawg
Set if off from your right dawg
Set it off, nigga, I said set it off (Set, set, set if off)

You know me, V.I.P., no ID
Bottles of DP, I do it real BIG
Bitches break their necks to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstacy without ecstacy
I'm the chef, you need a hit, I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor, jam-packed, look

Set it off, nigga, I said set it off (Set, set, set if off)

'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah, do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high, then hit me low
Get to poppin' and shakin' that thang on the floor
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, 'cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I'll stay with it
Hit the telly, play wit it, in a major way get it

Numb / Encore,"Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo! (Let's go)
Can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah!
Now, what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
Get 'em Jay!
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration (-tion)
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him (him)
With cheap imitations for these generations
Can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, yeah
Now, what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
We're in the four five, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you, I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (come on)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore? Do you want more? (more, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar"

Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me

So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple G's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon' lie

Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is
Girl give me that pussy

Girl give me girl give me that there"

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by, they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up""
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone, ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol, and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (oak)
Music loud and tippin' slow (slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producing?""
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I'm still ain't losin'

Just swerved, all up in the curve and
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce on my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air, Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear-view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin' (keep tryin')
'Cause they denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (tags)
Pull me over try to check my slab (slab)
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about 'em not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (saying ""I do"")
Because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)

Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (tell me, would you?)
See what's the point in waiting anymore
'Cause, girl, I've never been more sure (that, baby, it's you)

But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will

Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side

Aftermath
(Look at that bitch, shit, hey!)
There she go
Shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget the ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered, puke drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated, till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good, pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall, with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We about to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

Ohh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it, swallow it and now finish
Yeah!
Me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we (finna, finna have a)
We about have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded (man I told ya!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
Now, look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Now, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me

Ohh girl, shake that ass for me

Shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
I ain't leaving without you, bitch!
You're comin' home with me
And my boy

Haha, Nate Dogg!"
Pullin' Me Back,"Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps telling me that, me that
Everything gonna be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
It was all good at first, spending money, going shopping
Eating at the finest restaurants and if I'm club hopping
She was right there with me, bottle popping, living that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like
We didn't have a worry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Say what?
Baby, I'ma superstar and that come with it
Gotta good nigga on your side, you better run with it
Even though I'm on the road doing shows
I made time for me and her, relationship to grow
They tell me, don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
'Cause when I'm outta town, always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sitting here, looking crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps telling me that, me that
Everything gonna be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Walk in the house with hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguing, can I have dinner with some dessert, uh uh
She talking 'bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clowning
Before we end up fighting, let me leave
I'm exhausted and this here, I don't need
Now I'm with the fellaz, riding and drinking
She blowin' my two-way up, but I need some time for thinking
Yeah, I wanna go back, but something saying, naw
Lemme give her some space and the next day, I might call
What should I do? Look, lemme ask y'all
Should I stand tall or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down with having my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes, either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sitting here, looking crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps telling me that, me that
Everything gonna be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times led to bad times, and you ain't see it coming
Tried your best to make her happy, but it wasn't enough
'Cause, mama told me in relationships, the road get rough
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts, I gotta move to the next route, yes
I thought I was her man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sitting there, looking crazy like damn
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps telling me that, me that
Everything gonna be all right
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Said, we gotta make it work, baby"

They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the mayne
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, yeah, I'm gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight 'cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar (buying the bar)
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gon' get lit up
You leave your drank around me
Believe your drank gon' get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gon' get stuck
These niggas is spies
We live them lives and keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple, and swallow it down
With the yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

Let's get high, nigga, smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my Gs
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own
'Cause them niggas there let me smoke for free
What's up Mary? How you doing?
Mary Jane (stalking me)

Premro full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush, it cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at?
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this
And breath again a whole lot of weed
But I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Hit me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh"
Why You Wanna,"T.I.P Pimpin'
Ay shawty why u wanna act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' be nice to ya
Go and tell a nigga no wit an ass so fat
Hey why u wanna go and do that love huh?
Hey why u wanna go and do that do dat
Hey why u wanna go and do dat dat dat
And the relationship been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey why u wanna go and do that love huh
Hey why u wanna go and do that do dat
Hey why u wanna go and do dat dat dat
Can't help but notice how ya glowin' I can see in ya face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to bein' replaced
Swear I treat u like a queen u put me in his place
So you could give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that u need ya space
Tell the niggas one thing u don?t need to chase
I wanna kiss u everywhere between ya knees and waist
Hear the sounds that u make and get ya knees to shake
Holla at me in the A you feel u need to escape
Got a mansion and a gate, you wit me and you safe
There?s a phantom and a truck wit 23's to skate
600 g's in the safe how much cheese it take
This a chance u need to take it ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today it's somethin' special and it feel like fate
Hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' ya sad makin' ya stay
Can he touch it like that and make it feel like this
How he left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make u feel it in ya chest
Take advantage of what you concealin' in ya dress
What he think he too fresh to show u that u the best
Compliment u on ya intellect and treat u wit respect
Make u sex till u sweat tongue kissin' on ya neck
It's been a while since u got it like this I bet
And I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this not yet
Know u confused ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how u keep sayin' no when ya panties so wet?
Ay
This nigga playin' mind games man
I think the time came that ya mind changed ya understand?
Life is like a chess move u need to make the next move ya best move
Keep it pimpin' ya understand?
Hey
I mean you know I'm sayin' I showed u how I feel you know what I'm sayin'
I put myself all the way out there you know
Ball in your court man but I jus got one question for u
Is you happy?"
I'm Sprung,"Oooh she got me doin', what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G

Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
It's somethin bout'cha
That's got me doin things I said I'd never do
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin' you
And I could care less, I could give a damn
'Cause see you my ride or die
You're a down ass b- who don't take no sh-
Keep it real though and still look fly
Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my w- and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly b- steppin up out my whip
I'm your n- girl we like ""This done""
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung
Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everythang with me
When it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started f- with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her s- on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
Oooh so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung
Dog she got me
Got me doin' things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do
You do

Comin' down at the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
In G5s or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the world has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more

When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever

Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal),"Da, da, da, da
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full-grown, full-grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Like a little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you

I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know
My daddy told me so

My Love (feat. T.I.),"Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (saying ""I do"")
Because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love, girl, my love, my love
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (tell me, would you?)
See what's the point in waiting anymore
'Cause, girl, I've never been more sure (that, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waiting for (just saying ""I do"")
Because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)

My love, girl, my love, my love
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't what you hesitatin' for, man
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (love)
My love (love)
My love (love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (love)
My love (love)
My love (love)

'Cause I done looked I done searched and it's hard to find
Another shorty like mine, baby, yes I'm
Addicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked
Hopin' that you stay with me
Search around the world, but you will never find

She would be the redrum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one to make me stop
Carin' about other girls on my jock and gettin' them
She was the one to slow me down, hold me down, I roll with her now
Go with it now, I'ma grow with it now
I'm a go get it, that's how, I got her
Don't be mad you can't get one hotter
Broke the mold when they made lil' momma
I don't care what my niggas say
She been there e'ryday for my drama

Wish they the one's that was datin' my woman
Gon' get a good look 'cause she fine

I wanna give her the world and I ain't never tryin' to lose her
I'm addicted to my girl and the way she twirls in that little skirt
Just for me, in the club, in the crib, in the streets
She reps for L.B. Dub E-N-T
She a nice size, with them pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner with the right prize and I'ma give it to her
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, she got a beautiful mind you can't buy that
And the sight from behind when she walk on by
Make a nigga wanna try that
She got the prettiest smile and she gangsta
Keep me from runnin' wild and I thank her
And we can talk about anythin', she got good conversation
My homie, my friend and plus she patient
Only thing that keeps me up, when I'm feelin' down

They call me Diddy, DJ Philly-Phil
Testing one, two, three (testing one, two, three)
Check this out, listen to me, listen
It's tricky, I'm picky baby, but I just spotted you doin' your thing
G-string, shoe string, I cornered you (hey)
Lend me your body, you got me in a zone (c'mon)
I made a million and a half cash, I could make you explode
You don't wanna break the code, you wanna day that comes
I could take you on outer limits away from home (where your bills pop)
Mama wallin' for sho', in the middle of the club doin' a rodeo show
The host has seen me, wet dream me, invisible sex, clean me
(Incredible sex) You need me, ease me, please me, baby
I maybe have a little crazy but in a way that every day you played me
Don't make me get fucked in here
Shawty droppin' to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And I'ma get fucked in here
Damn lil' mama, know you fit my standards
You're the type to make me grip that handle
Lick, shots in the air, bussin' that friend oh
While you make it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Just shake that thang, shake that thang
She could make it clap like a standing ovation
Spin like my record at the radio station
Feel the sensation, I put it right there
They be like, ""Looner"", I be like, ""Yeah""
You like it like that, don't you baby?
The flow's insane and the stroke is crazy
I stroke so good, like Tiger Woods
Then I - like a tiger would
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still south side Atlanta, that's a lively hood
I surface, big time, like Ringlin' brothers
If you wanna learn something (what?) bring your mothers
Sit back and observe, invite supremes
We could mix it all up like juice and gin
Phelly on the cell, he with a couple of twins
'Cause tonight damn right we gonna do it again
Don't make me get fucked in here
Shawty droppin' to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And I'ma get fucked in here
Damn lil' mama, know you fit my standards
You're the type to make me grip that handle
Lick, shots in the air, bussin' that friend oh
While you make it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang
While you make it clap, clap, clap, clap, clap (hey yo)
Just shake that thang, shake that thang (hey yo Phelly)
Let me get this one more time, okay (listen)
Women lace 'em, G4 Jet from 'em
Twist 'em crooked, cell phone numbers crowded
Flip 'em, change 'em, prissy 'em, boujee the hood (let's go)
Game 'em, taste 'em, trizzy's 'em runnin' them good
Leather or silk, I melt them all (tough tune)
Love 'em, leave 'em, give 'em hell for sure (don't stop)
Tell 'em worthy minds are so deserve (don't stop)
Or give 'em things they might prefer (keep it goin')
'Sandro pain, manner is sweet massagin'
Pimp, Game and grant some bitches, I trawl them
Used to style 'em, now I just virgin isle 'em
Kama sutra, freaky needs, don't stop 'em
Don't make me get fucked in here
Shawty droppin' to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal
And I'ma get fucked in here
Damn lil' mama, know you fit my standards
You're the type to make me grip that handle
Lick, shots in the air, bussin' that friend oh
Hold on, hold on, hold on
This your boy, little junk, right?
They tryna take this thing to another level
Let's go
Let's go
Let me see you get your hands up (put 'em up, put 'em up)
Let me see you get your hands up (put 'em up, put 'em up)
Let me see your put your breaks up (put 'em up, put 'em up)
Let me see your put your breaks up (put 'em up, put 'em up)

Hey, ayo fella, you a fool for that one, man"
I Tried,"Bone Thugs... Akon, yeah
You know don't nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard, but I guess I gotta try harder
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough
First let me explain that I'm just a black man (a black man)
And I come from the dark side so I'm having a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back
Prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really im wrong and again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane
Chasing me dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me goin' craaaazzzy lately
I've been so faded
Tryin' to erase it
But I just can't cuz the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough
It's like I'm taking 5 steps forward and 10 steps back
Tryin to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin away from the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close
And uhh, I just don't know but I be out here fighting demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord would you help me (help me)
And stop this pain I keep inficting on my family (my family)
Hustlin' and gamblin'
Trickin' and scramblin'
And losing sight of what I'm sposed to be handlin
It's hard to manage
Cuz everydays a challenge
And man I'm slippin'
Can't lose my balance I'm tryin' not to panic
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back (pullin' me back)
Got me doin' dirty dirty
So used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no nine to five work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave
Until the sun came up
Gotta get it no nope not leaving no what
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you (on you)
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through
I've Tried so hard, I can't seem to get away from misery
Man i've tried so hard but will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cuz I try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough"
Shawty (feat. T Pain),"Ay, what's happenin' homie?

Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone (shawty)
Sing it to me girl
Soon as I seen her, shit, told her I'd pay for it
Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city, baby, you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she aint even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat you, baby, I'm liable to fuck up your whole life
I got her trained, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust it baby 'cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whatever I wanna get off, she know how to get me right
Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my (shawty)
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my (shawty)

I love to show her off, 'cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat badly, look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the corner
She proud to be fuckin' me, 'cause I'm stuntin' on 'em
It feel good to be fuckin' a real nigga don't'uh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin' her off, 'cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin', 'cause I done beat her under
Baby snatchin', not now, I'm tellin' ya, I promise
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame
'Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just ask me is it her thing
Ever since I ran up in shawty she ain't been the same
Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my (shawty)
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my (shawty)
And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do

Let It Go,"You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he
Where he wanna be, yeah
New Keyshia
Yes (woo)
Fire
I like this one right her
This one for all my ladies y'all
Holla
Let's go
I don't want yo' man
'Cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like that (eh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
Yo' man he be callin' me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact (eh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
He asked how I do that that
Fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin'
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man
I understand why you wanna try
Make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
Remember when I gave everything I've got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me?
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he
Where he wanna be
If he ain't gonna love you the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna love you the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you the way he should
Then let it go
When this song come on in the club
They gonna be like, damn, that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gonna drop they tops like, damn, that's hot
They gonna mix it with Biggie ""It was all a dream""
Like, damn that's hot
Me and Keyshia won't stop 'til the tick don't tock
Like, damn that's hot
Now understand why I take my time
'Cause you come with alibis
Tryna get me to see that's where you tryna be
But I don't want your man
Your man's been callin' me
Tryna get me to see
That he wants me to be with him
But he ain't the one for me
And if you only knew
You would do what you had to
Finally see that (finally get the chance to see that)
You need to get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he
Where he wanna be
Now here's a little lesson Lil Kim don't stress 'em
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke up with my Ex he with her for now but
Little do she know she just a rebound
Callin' my phone she so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl you need to stop it
When he's with you, he's wishin' it was me
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be baby, baby
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
And if he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go (hands up in the air)
When this song come on in the club
They gonna be like, damn, that's hot
And when they play it in they car
They gonna drop they tops like, damn, that's hot
They gonna mix it with Biggie ""It was all a dream""

And got an entourage and her own paparazzi

Backstrokin', sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down (Down, down)

The smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?
You got me saying, ayo!
I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, (So), I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, (So), I gotta give it to her
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized, let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized, let me tell you"
Outta My System (feat. T-Pain & Johntá Austin),"Damn, I mean, I just keep thinkin' about you
I mean, I wanna move on, but I can't move on
It's like you got some kinda hold on me and, man, I don't know
But I'ma go ahead and talk about it, listen
I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You're still runnin' through my mind
When I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me all on your mind and I'm knowin' that it couldn't be
'Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lotta pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin' 'round with other chicks, I'm single and they lovin' it
I'm likin' it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know
You got a hold or some kinda control of me
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin' at it, and it ain't gettin' no better
Just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of starin' out this glass, lookin' at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together, 'cause
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system
And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system
I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that
And when I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin', where you at, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin' me, ""Just let her go, Bow""
Believe me, I'm tryin', man, I just don't know how
I be in all the top spots, leavin' with the hot shots
Knowin' they just want me 'cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin'
Thinkin' who she with or where she goin', is she club hoppin'?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealin' with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right 'cause
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system
And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system
Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time, that's what kills me
Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time, and it kills me
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system
And you know what you do to me, do to me
You don't even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
It's so hard to get you outta my system
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard, and I still love you to this day
Peace"

Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers ha-ha-ha-ha, you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em, you can't man 'em then you mop 'em, you can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Mothafucka, I'm ill
A million here a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoke in the thinnest air, I open the Lamborghini
Hoping them crackers see me like look at that bastard Weezy
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothing, nothing, you ain't scaring nothing
On some faggot bullshit, call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shit
Motherfucka I'm ill, not sick and I'm okay, but my watch sick
Yeah, my drop sick, yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick, I'm it
Mothafucka, I'm ill
They say I'm rapping like B.I.G, Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil' Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that boy, you knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Mothafucka, I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me, they don't feel me, but they fear me

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a lil? bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil momma, what you drank?
I know that you're a freak
But you know I ain? t gon say shh""
See my game is outrageous

(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a draught in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

It drives the world crazy
She used to be
She used to be the sweetest girl
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour Amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him
Where my money at?

It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life
Uh, homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
Welcome to the good life
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish

Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
Welcome to the good life

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, ""I never seen snakes on a plane""
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's the everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas (welcome to the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine the good life (hey)
Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feelin' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good"

My Life,"And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My Life
Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide (suicide, suicide)
I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die""
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
Cause that's Jesus people
And The Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation, so I can leave my people
They askin' ""Why?"" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle
And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My Life
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24's spinnin' I earned them
And I ain't no preacher but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his momma proud
And since you helped me sell my +Dream+ we can share my momma now
And like M.J.B.: ""No More Drama"" now
Living the ""Good Life"", me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My Life
Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts
Listening to the ""Chronic"" album, playing backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?

I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
Ha, and you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, ""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot

Love Lockdown,"I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, no-no""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I'll be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose

Crack A Bottle (feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent),"Oh, ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey, like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown
Motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move"", a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I notice there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust

Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
(Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag)
Neiman Marcus, you know what I mean, and all that, ya, come on

Ain't nothin' so-so, and I know Jay Dee well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray CL
Got niggas lookin' like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonda what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louie on my labels

You wit' the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like
Son, I'm from Brooklyn, what it look like?
You get it 'cause I got it, I got it, so you get it
In Miami, they say don't stop, get it, get it
Mommy do the speedie, daddy do tha duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talkin' ruffles
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
See I know what I'ma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it suppose to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar got him spendin' plenty bar
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't gotta know so
Such a gentlemen, dozen bottles of that rose mo
Oh, you gotta man, well you need a richa one
Meet me in the parking lot, the place say get you one
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checkin', you can help them in a second

I Love College,"I'm nice right now, I, I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air
That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip bankers club and drink miller lite
On thirsty Thursday and Tuesday night ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Lets get fucked up
I'm next on the table
Who want what
I am champion at beer pong
Allen Iverson Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it
Otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
Man I love college (hey) and I love drinking (hey)
I love women (hey) man I love college
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But I could tell you a story or two
Um yea of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if shes too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night find a new joint
Hold the beer bong
Nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
Man I love college (hey) and I love drinking (hey)
I love women (hey) I love college
Now if everybody would please
Put their drink as high as they can
As high as they can
And repeat after me
Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
Freshman freshman freshman freshman
Do something crazy do something crazy do something crazy do something crazy
Keg-stand keg-stand keg-stand keg-stand
Yea, that party last night
Man I love college, I love it
That party last night
Goodnight everybody I gotta head back to class for a little bit
That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again man I love college
Do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life"

Forever,"It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name, Ever, first name, Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothin' to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I'm Forever Mr. West In The Building Ain't No Question You About To Kill Em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'
You'd think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at All
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last Oh!
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me, so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, son
Just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man"
California Gurls,"Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet n' wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees

The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Not Afraid,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (to take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (everybody)
I guess I had to go to that place
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
To get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you might still be in that place
Whatever weather, cold or warm
If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
Find Your Love,"I'm more than just an option (hey, hey, hey)

I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your loving (find your loving)
I better find your heart (I better find your heart)
I better find your loving (I better find your loving)

Young Forever,"Can I get some light in here?
Cellphones in the air
Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man (sing)
Forever young
I wanna be forever young (yes)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever (sing)
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment
Smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut we'll be fine, ah
Sing
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever young
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous, hold up
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking more shit
I be talking more shit, I'm nauseous, hold up
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, baby, bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet I'm painting you a portrait
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
And ever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever (your time, sing)
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

Over,"I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
Til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
Til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
Til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
Til it's over
But it's far from over"
Deuces (feat. Tyga & Kevin McCall),"All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need
She knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Chuckin' up them deuces
I told you that I'm leaving
Deuces
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finnin' throw them deuces up
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
Used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip, but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for? I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
She make wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care 'bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear 'bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You make me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her"

Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'

You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act

Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover

There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me, so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, son
Just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

That glitterin' may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up
When times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys
I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on

Anybody ever wonder
When they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
So, no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on

Lighters,"This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fucking feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid? Flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
And now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls?
As if this ain't some bullshit, people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch-blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say ""Thanks"", 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bitch raise 'cause I came with 5'9, but I feel like I'm 6'8
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron
To going and buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up (hang it up)
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that?
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight, but tonight we're alright
So hold up your light, let it shine, 'cause
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"
Moment 4 Life,"I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

I Need A Doctor,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon' hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy
Or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me, get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake!
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as
I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man!"" 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life"

She Will,"Young money, yeah, four
I tell her, ""Now goin' pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet, ha ha
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""Baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah, do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Yeah, I tell her ""Now go on, pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that wine and dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say chose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""Baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel

Payphone,"I'm at a payphone trying to call home

Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time, when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm strutting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show you can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled valet open doors
Wiz like go away got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go
And take that little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong

Like, ""is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?""

Ride around town in the big old Range

Now the little nigga doing big old thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: ""baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there""
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair, but
So is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink, just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

Holy Grail,"You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why)

Uh, fuck that shit y'all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
Bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, mama please just get my bail

I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit just ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
Still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller

It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
You get the air out my lungs, whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleeding, I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code

Bad (feat. Tiara Thomas),"Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems we fiend for what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I'm not bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad no)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yeah
But to kiss them saying you mean that
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, motion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Let me tell you about, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck"
Berzerk,"Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it""
So sick, I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, ba-wit-da-ba dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow, chicka-bow, chicka-bow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vi-
Everybody
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry, yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers shithead with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangols and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd ma'am
You birdbrain baby, I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow (ha-ha)
Word, Rick? Word, man you heard, but don't be discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go

Swimming Pools (Drank),"Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
(W-watch 'em all flock)
Aw man, where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor I'ma die in it)
All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in -'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see someone
Aha, got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?

Can't see me through my tints (nuh-uh)
I'm ridin' real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, drippin', shinnin', like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (nuh-uh), but I'm on those Vogues (yeah)
That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright-bright
Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of (woo)
Lookin' down from heaven like, damn, that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantasic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge

Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school (old), old school (old)
Candy paint (candy paint), two-seater (ow)
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind (oh-oh)
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Sendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fuckin' lottery homes (fuckin' lottery homes)
Uh (yeah), tires with the spokes on it (yeah), and the Vogues too (uh)
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, never park the whip
See what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-some
Swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it

If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Everybody knows and I feel left out

Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

That can only mean one thing

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

She say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree, yeha
That's right I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you, yeah
So thick that everyone else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, and I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it (Pinkprint, ayy)
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygroove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga for reals
If you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only"

Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich

Truffle Butter,"Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?

Man, this the sixty-five million singles sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?
Do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss every day, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, 'cause I meant it, yeah
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
Lol to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
'Cause she gonna say, ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some Cocaine, if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi and Barbie you know"

Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man, this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest

I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' over time on the overtime

Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who, put it back together? (Aight)

"Me, Myself & I","Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul (ah)
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends
Ooh (yeah), it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (got me for life, yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
I don't need anything (yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
'Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time (yeah)
And I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say, ""Fuck y'all"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers, I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly, this shit is lovely
This shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it, tell me now, isn't it funny?
Ooh (nah), it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die

'Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time
Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Ooh (yeah), it's just me, myself and I

Too Good,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, look
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular

With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""Why you got to stare?"" Face

Everything'll get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dawg, he say it's all the way retarded

Hater, wish you well

They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gon' learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juugin' 'round the city, you know what it is

Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she 'round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl, I'm sorry
You just high yella, you not that important
Waist shaper, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this

Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it

How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now, I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead, I'm in the trap though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
You know what I'm on, aye
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye

Black Beatles,"Black beatles in the city be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
Gettin' so cold I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain
I'm a fuckin black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin' ""everybody's famous""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me
I think she trollin'
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', real life goals
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin school clothes
Watch me break the money machine till her clothes fall
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
My Chapos servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in

I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to skrrting out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I... I spy with my little eye

Bounce Back,"If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know

Cold (feat. Future),"Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah
Feel so different, yeah.

Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryin'a cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore

Fettuccini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old
When I had told myself, ""Okay, you're special""
But I treat you like my equal, never lesser
I was twenty-six years old
When we had dropped this one amazin' record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""Why you got to stare?"" Face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami
In the middle of the party bitch get off me (off me)

Him & I (with Halsey),"Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true, "" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (you know?)
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)

Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (together), fuck up clubs together (together)
And we'd both go crazy (crazy) if we was to sever
You know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt

MIDDLE CHILD,"You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real"
Drip Too Hard (Lil Baby & Gunna),"Run that back, Turbo!
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Every other night, another movie get made (yeah)
Every other night, another dollar getting made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancing in the dial, like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GunWun not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches getting saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lacking, why I'm working on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names (uh)
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind

Goodbyes (feat. Young Thug),"Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the edge
So - it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got - to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both acting insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the edge
Don't - with me tonight
Said you needed this heart then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you right in my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna to cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argues possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watching the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered
And I don't want you never go outside
I promise if they play, my - slidin'
I'm - her and the tour bus still ridin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave

Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave ya
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts

A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (about it)

Emotionally Scarred,"A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""

I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now

The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew?
Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

The Bigger Picture,"Protests and growing national outcry continues
Over the death of George Floyd
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
Trade my 4 x 4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again
I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead
But still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us
Then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear"

Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately, I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

And we might have a child when I'm finished
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, ""Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it""

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy-ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different, got me looking stupid (damn)
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head

Holy (feat. Chance The Rapper),"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say, ""Fools rush in""
But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say, ""Fools rush in""
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy"

It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done
I probably should pick that cup back up (haha)
I'm seein' her lookin' like Keisha, like
""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (candy), sweet like fruit (ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost

Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I popped back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffe cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie, you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (that strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' my home (in my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with a heart to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (that somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept, Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
42 millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind

DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out, ""YOLO, "" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind

When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wyling?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order ′42 for the table, let's pop shit
Missionary or doggy style, I'ma top shit
Pussy ass niggas hating on me from the closet, ah

Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
′Cause a bitch spit a whole lot of venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked, and I′ll stop at every mirror
Just to stare at my own posterior
I 'on′t a give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear

Hands on my knees, shaking ass on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shaking ass on my thot shit

Hands on my knees, shaking ass on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

Hoes say they wish a bitch would, and I′m a genie
Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep begging to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VV's
No, I′m not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I'm ordering CC's

Go to your place, no face, no case
99 percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me, happily
Now I′m bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they riding, whole time tryna pass me
Watching me go through it, still tryna drag me
Acting like you winning, if you think about it, actually
Are they supporting you, or really just attacking me?
I ′on't give a fuck ′bout a blog tryna bash me

Bitch dry hating, tryna get noticed
Man, ain′t nobody come to see you, Otis

Look, how many bitches lying if saying they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I′m really talking, but it can really apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or nigga

Big bank take lil′ bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes taking shots but they ain't in my caliber
Booked but I squeeze a lil′ head in my calendar
Looking in the mirror like, ""Damn, I 'on′t brag enough""

LV's, double C's, Birkins, I′m working
My chain ain′t hitting if a bitch ain't hurting
Look, I ain′t even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain

None of these hoes saying shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talking all the shit that I want
And I doubt one of you hoes come tell me I can′t
We ain't even speaking if the nigga ain′t spending
He can't never say that I was one of his women
I 'on′t even let niggas know where I stay
I′ll be damned if he think he popping up on this pimping

Hands on my knees, shaking ass on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shaking ass on my thot shit
