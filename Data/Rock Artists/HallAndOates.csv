Rich Girl,Unavailable
Maneater,"She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh here she comes)
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh here she comes)
She's a maneater
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man, she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh here she comes)
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
(Oh here she comes)
She's a maneater
Ooh,
Oh here she comes
Here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Whoa here she comes
(Watch out)
She's a maneater
Oh here she comes
(She's a maneater)
Ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh here she comes)
(Watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh here she comes)
Here she comes
She's a maneater
(Oh here she comes)
(She's a maneater)
The woman is wild ooh
(Oh here she comes)
Here she comes
Watch out boy, watch out boy
(Oh here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh here she comes)
Yeah yeah she's a maneater
(Oh here she comes)
(She's a maneater)
She's watching and waiting ooh
(Oh here she comes)
Oh she's a maneater"
Sara Smile,"Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you and me forever
Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara
If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
If you want to be free, you know, all you got to do is say so
And when you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever
Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara
Sara smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara
Smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara
Oh smile a while, won't you laugh Sara
Make me feel like a man not keeping me crazy crazy
Smile a while"

Private Eyes,"I see you, you see me
Watch you blowin' the lines
When you're making a scene
Oh girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks
The senses will show to my heart
When it's watching for lies
You can't escape my
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you watching
You watching you watching you
You play with words you play with love
You can twist it around baby that ain't enough
'Cause girl I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in or letting me go
Don't lie when you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you watching
You watching you watching you
Why you try to put up a front for me
I'm a spy but on your side you see
Slip on, into any disguise
I'll still know you
Look into my
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move

Out of Touch,"Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
Time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time"
Kiss on My List,"My friends wonder why I call you all the time
What can I say
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, no, I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why
your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
(Because your kiss) is what I miss when I turn out the lights
I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing
I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you, I couldn't go on
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why
your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
(Because your kiss) is what I miss when I turn out the lights
I really miss you babe
your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
(Because your kiss) is what I miss when I turn out the lights
your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life"
One On One,"I'm tired of playing on the team
It seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score oh
Oh oh I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh yeah, you've got to understand baby
Time out is what I'm here for
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one I know I want to play that
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one so slow
You can't tell me you don't miss me girl
I think I might know you too well
Wonder what you'd say if you knew that I was coming tonight
(Want to) I want you can't you tell
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one I know I want to play that
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one so slow
That's all you need to know now
'Cause if it's really right there's nothing else
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one I want to play that game tonight
One on one, girl
There's nothing else but you and me
I don't want no one else
I don't want no one else
Baby I am tired of playing
I am tired of playing
I don't want to play those games no more, no more
I want to play with you girl
I want to play with you girl
Just you and me
You and me
You and me"

When the Morning Comes,"I went downtown to see my lady
She stood me up and I stood there waiting
It'll be all right
When the morning comes
Now I'm up in the air with the rain in my hair
I've got nowhere to go, I can go anywhere
It'll be all right
When the morning comes
Just in passing, I'm not asking
That you be anyone but you
When you come home, try to come home alone
It's so much better with two
Now I'm out in the cold, and I'm getting old
Standing here, waiting on you
It'll be all right
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
Just in passing, I'm not asking
That you be anyone but you
When you come home, try to come home alone

Standing here, waiting on you
It'll be all right

You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,"You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips

Say It Isn't So,"Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it isn't so painful to tell me that you're dissatisfied
Last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen you see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way that bites it even more
Say it
Tell me what you want yeah I'll do it baby I promise right now
Say it
Who propped you up when you were stopped low motivation
Had you on the ground
I know your first reaction you slide away hide away goodbye
But if there's a doubt maybe I can give out a thousand reasons why
You have to say it isn't so
I say it isn't so
(It isn't so) I say it isn't so
(It isn't so) said it isn't so
(It isn't so) oh no
Say it
We like to be the strangers at the party, two rebels in a shell
Say it
You like to move with the best of them you know we move so well
Don't need someone to lean on, I know that there's an open door
But if I'm faced with being replaced I want you even more
So baby say it isn't so
say it isn't so
(It isn't so) I say it isn't so

Family Man,"She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose as she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide if he should hold his ground
But he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might, yeah""
She turned, tossed her head
Unlike her opening move, her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up, she was gone
Then he screamed, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And I don't think I want it tonight""
Then he said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
Don't leave me alone 'cause I got to go home, please
""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And I don't think I want it tonight"""
Las Vegas Turnaround (The Stewardess Song),"Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes, she's here, and sometimes
She can't be found turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes, she's here, and sometimes
She can't be found turnaround
And Sara's off, half hiding, far above the clouds
High she flies, I know I've got to find her a place
She can push her toes around in
She needs a place where she can lounge
And wear a gown in Sara turnaround
Turn, turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes, she's here, and sometimes
She can't be found turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
Las Vegas, sometimes, she's not around, turnaround
In any night, well, she's here
Halfway around the world, oh, I could cry
And so, I know I've got to pray for delays
And for days 'til she's besides me
Ooh, all alone in her room
And her scattered clothes remind me
Sara, please (Sara turnaround)
Las Vegas turnaround (Sara, please)
She's going to Las Vegas (Sara, please)
Las Vegas turnaround (Sara, please)
She's going to Las Vegas (Sara, please)

You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away

Fall in Philadelphia,"There's a thunder storm 'a brewin'
And the day is turning gray
There ain't much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin'
And the ceiling's fallin' in
And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter
I've got to move myself out to the country
I'm lookin' out for any place at all
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia
A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope
Say, the stolen bikes are gathering by the thousands
Along with seven million people without a hope
I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia"
Had I Known You Better Then,"Were you ever so in love
You couldn't wait to get to sleep and dream
About the one you wish was there beside you
In the past few days, I've grown
To love your giggles on the phone
And how we hug so nicely
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
I would've said those three old words
And from the first time I saw you
Had I known you better then
Now I'm gonna move away
Another town, another crazy day
Ooh, I want to stay and maybe hang around you
Call it luck (call it luck)
Call it fate
Call it a shame that we have met so late
And loved so lightly
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then (had I known you)
I would've said those three old words
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
Had I known you better then, oh, hmm
Were you ever so much in love
You couldn't wait to get to sleep and dream
About the one you wish was right there beside you
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then (had I known you)
I would've said those three old words
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
Had I known you better then
Had I known you, had I known you better
Had I known you, had I known you better
Had I known, had I known you better then
Had I known, had I known you better
Had I known, had I known you better
Had I known, had I known you better

Wait for Me,"Midnight hour almost over
Time is running out for the magic pair
I know you gave the best that you have
But one more chance
Couldn't be all that hard to bear
Wait for me please
Wait for me
Alright, I guess
That's more than I should ask
Why won't you wait for me
Please wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
You could go either way
Is it easier to stay
I wonder what you'll do
When your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much
I want to keep you
When I'm away I'm afraid
It will all fall down
So wait for me please
Wait for me
Alright, I guess
That's more than I should ask
Why won't you wait for me
Please wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
Love is what it does
And ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent
It must be good for something
Please forgive all the disturbance
I'm creating
But you got a lot to learn if you think
That I'm not waiting for you
So wait for me please
Wait for me
Alright, I guess
That's more than I should ask
Why won't you wait for me
Please wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
Yes it is

Dry in the Sun,"We were fourteen days from Toronto
With a handmade highway
For a friend
Well, Dave figured
We were due to see a town
He thought he saw some smoke
Drift round the bend
It was ten o'clock
When the Mohawks hit
And the fun had just begun
They tied a friend of mine
With binder twine
And left him to dry in the sun
Well, Dave droped first
With an arrow in the head
And his horse Smiley she fell screamin'
Dave looked at me
And saw the blood in his hands
He stared ahead like he was dreamin'
It was ten o'clock
When the Mohawks hit
And the fun had just begun
They tied a friend of mine
With binder twine
And left him to dry in the sun
I made the bushes
Oh, I don't know how
And lay there silent and sobbin'
I looked at Dave
And I peered at Bill
I saw their life blood droppin'
As the Indians continue
I thought of the rhyme
I can't stop myself from repeatin'
They tied a friends of mine
Woth binder twine
And left him to dry in the sun"

Ooh, I'm sorry

Alone Too Long,"Just a little boy lost looking for a lamb in the all night city
Living in his lonely limousine
And though he never has to worry
He's the only one and only one he's ever gonna need
Absolutely he's in definite need
Of a woman, child,
And some better kind of love when the hot town's hurt him
And he knows how happy he could be
But he don't know if he can make it
Between the money and another lonely night
But now the time has come
Got to stay or run
Now the time has come
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonely
Another pretty face another body ache still awake three-thirty
Dial another number -- No one home
So he wastes his time with TV
And he wonders if he lost the only one
And wonders if he's free
Too afraid to see
How alone he could be
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonely"

So Close,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over she slipped out of his arms
And out of the door, yes you did
Yeah a man loves a woman but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club where the long shadows fall
Drop a coin in the jukebox not the phone on the wall
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away
Some people think if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yeah I know someone who just heads for the sun
(She says)
""I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young""
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, but we stuck in today
Baby we're so close, so close, so far away
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart
(So close)
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream that's gonna tear us, tear us apart
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Are you looking for somewhere, end up here
(I see you looking in my eye)
We gotta fight, to keep it together girl
For the dreams that keeps us
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
The who would've thought girl that we end up this way
Given so close, so close, so far away
We're livin' in a dream world
