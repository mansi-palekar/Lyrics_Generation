Sweet Caroline - Classic Diamonds,"Where it began, I can't begin to knowing
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along
Hands, touching hands
Reaching out, touching me, touching you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I
Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
We filled it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holding you
One, touching one
Reaching out, touching me, touching you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no, no
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good"

Cracklin' Rosie - Single Version,"Aw, Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
We're gonna ride
'Till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
And Lord, don't you know
We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady
Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
No need to say please to no man
For a happy tune
Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose
You're a store bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
Cus We got all night to set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions
Yeah
Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose
You're a store bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
'Cause we got all night
To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions

I Am...I Said - Single Version,"L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
And the feeling is ""lay back""
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back
Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still
Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one
But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone
""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am""... I cried
""I am""... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
""I am""... I said
""I am""... I cried
""I am"""
Forever In Blue Jeans,"Money talks
But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans
Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you'd pardon me, I'd like to say
We'd do okay forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone, you and I
Nothing around but the sound
Of my heart and your sighs
Money talks
But it can't sing and dance and it can't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans, babe
And honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you'll pardon me, I'd like to say
We'd do okay, forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone, you and I
Nothing around but the sound
Of my heart and your sighs
Money talks
But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans
And if you'd pardon me, I'd like to say
We'd do okay forever in blue jeans, babe
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be forever in blue jeans, babe"
September Morn,"Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door
Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before
September morn
Do you remember
How we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morning
Still can make me feel that way"
Song Sung Blue,"Song sung blue
Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Sing them out again
Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it get to feeling good
You simply got no choice
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it started feeling good
You simply got no choice
Song sung blue
Song sung blue
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice"
"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon","Girl, you'll be a woman soon
I love you so much, can't count all the ways
I've died for you girl and all they can say is
""He's not your kind""
They never get tired of putting me down
And I'll never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll need a man
I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're saying girl it cuts like a knife
""The boy's no good""
Well I've finally found what I'm a looking for
But if they get their chance they'll end it for sure
Surely would
Baby have done all I could
Now it's up to you
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll need a man
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon but soon, you'll need a man
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand"
You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural (used to be)
Talk about forever
But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away
And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
And I learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
(So you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye)
You don't bring me flowers anymore
Well, you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
Well, you don't say you need me
And you don't sing me love songs
You don't bring me flowers anymore"
Beautiful Noise,"What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the street
Got a beautiful sound
It's got a beautiful beat
It's a beautiful noise
Goin' on ev'rywhere
Like the clickety-clack
Of a train on a track
It's got rhythm to spare
It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it fits me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the park
It's the song of the kids
And it plays until dark
It's the song of the cars
On their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To the beat of the lights
It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise
It's a beautiful noise
Made of joy and of strife
Like a symphony played
By the passing parade
It's the music of life
It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Just like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise
Comin' into my room
And it's beggin' for me
Just to give it a tune"
Play Me,"She was morning
And I was nighttime
I one day woke up
To find her lying beside my bed
I softly said, ""Come take me""
For I was lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done someone wrong somewhere
But I don't know where
I don't know where
Come lately
You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me
Song she sang to me
Song she bring to me
Words that rang in me
Rhyme that sprang from me
Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me
You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me
And so it was
That I came to travel
Upon a road that was thorned and narrow
Another place
Another grace
Would save me
You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me
You are the sun, I am the moon
You are the words, I am the tune
Play me"

Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show,"… Hot August night
And the leaves hanging down
And the grass on the ground smelling sweet
… Move up the road
To the outside of town
And the sound of that good gospel beat
… Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees
And that gospel group
Telling you and me
… It's love, Brother Love say
Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show
… Room gets suddenly still
And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
… Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Every ear in the place is on him
… Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go
Half the valley shakes
… It's love, Brother Love say
Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
'Bout Brother Love's show
… Hallelujah, brothers
Halle-hallelujah
I said brothers
(Hallelujah) Now you got yourself two good hands
(Halle-hallelujah) And when your brother is troubled
You gotta reach out your one hand for him
(Hallelujah) 'Cause that's what it's there for
(Halle-hallelujah) And when your heart is troubled
You gotta reach out your other hand
(Hallelujah) Reach it out to the man up there
(Halle-hallelujah) 'Cause that's what he's there for
… Take my hand in yours
Walk with me this day
In my heart I know
I will never stray
Halle, halle, halle, halle, halle, halle, halle
… Love, Brother Love say

Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies

"Love On The Rocks - From ""The Jazz Singer"" Soundtrack","Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want
Is a smile
First they say they want you
Hear how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
Maybe blue skies above
But it's cool
When your love's on the rocks
First they say they want you
Hear how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you more lies
Yesterday's gone
And now all I want is a smile
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cool when your love's on the rocks
First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say

Longfellow Serenade,"Lonfellow serenade
Such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady
And I was a dreamer
With only words to trade
You know that I was born for a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely
And she was lonely
Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me make it warm for you
I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade
Longfellow serenade
Such were the plans I made
But she was a lady
As deep as a river
And through the night, we stayed
And in my way, I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more
For she was lonely
And I was lonely
Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make you dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you
I'll weave this web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade"
The Story Of My Life,"The story of my life
Is very plain to read
It starts the day you came
It ends the day you leave
The story of my life
Begins and ends with you
The names are still the same
The story's still the truth
I was alone
You found me waiting
And made me your own
I was afraid
That somehow I never could be
The man that you wanted of me
You're the story of my life
And every word is true
Each chapter sings your name
Each page begins with you
It's the story of our times
And never letting go
And if I die today
I wanted you to know
Stay with me here
Share with me, care with me
Stay and be near
And when it began
I'd lie awake every night
Just knowing somewhere deep inside
That our love affair just might write
The story of my life
It's so very plain to read
It starts the day you came
And ends the day you leave"
Shilo,"Young child with dreams
Dream ev'ry dream on your own
When children play
Seems like you end up alone
Papa says he'd love to be with you
If he had the time
So you turn on the only friend you can find
There in your mind
Shilo, when I was young
I used to call you name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came
And we'd play
Young girl with fire
Something said she understood
I wanted to fly
She made me feel like I could
Held my hand out, and I let her take me
Blind as a child
All I saw was the way that she made me smile
She made me smile
Shilo, when I was young
I used to call you name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came
And you'd stay
Had a dream, and it filled me with wonder
She had other plans
""Got to go, and I know that you'll understand""
I understand
Shilo, when I was young
I used to call you name
When no one else would come
Shilo, you always came
Come today"

Lonely Looking Sky,"Lonely looking sky, lonely sky

Never made it right
Lonely looking night

While we may

One more day
Glory looking day, glory day

And in it's glory told a simple way
Behold it if you may
Glory looking day
Glory looking day
Ah, lonely looking sky"
Stones - Single Version,"Stones would play inside her head,
And where she slept, they made her bed.
And she would ache for love and get
But stones.
La la la la la la la la la la home.
Lordy child a good days comin',
And I'll be there to let the sun in,
And bein' lost is worth the comin' home.
La la la la la la la la la on stones.
You and me a time for planting,
You and me a harvest granting,
The every prayer ever prayed,
We're just two wild flowers that grow.
La la la la la la la la la on stones."
I'm A Believer,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
And I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if i tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
And I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
And I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried
Oh, yeah
Said I'm a believer"

Desirée,"It was the third of June
On that summer's day
When I became a man
At the hands of a girl almost twice my age
And she came to me
Just like a morning sun
And it wasn't so much her words as such
As the way they were sung
It was the way they were sung
Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, Desiree?
Oh, Desiree
Somehow I knew
I could only have you 'til the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet Desiree, you made it right
Then came the fourth of June
On that sleepless night
Well, I tossed and I turned
While the thought of her burned up and down my mind
For she was there and gone
Without one regret
But she continues on
Like the words of a song
I could not forget, I could not forget
Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, Desiree?
Oh, Desiree
And though somehow I knew
I could only have you 'til the morning light
The night was long, the time was right
Do you remember, Desiree?
Oh, Desiree
Do you remember, Desiree?"
Skybird,"Skybird
Make your soul
And every heart will know
Of the tale
Skybird
Make your tune
For none may sing it
Just as you do
Look at the way I glide
Caught on the wind's laxy tide
Sweetly how it sings
Rally each heart at the sight
Of your silver wings
Skybird, skybird
Nightbird
Find your way
For none may know it
Just as you may"

If You Know What I Mean,"When the night returns just like a friend
When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day
Make peaceful sounds in me
Took a drag from my last cigarette
Took a drink from a glass of old wine
I closed my eyes, and I could make it real
And feel it one more time
Can you hear it, babe
Can you hear it, babe
From another time
From another place
Do you remember it, babe
And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean
If you know what I mean babe
Here's to the songs we used to sing
And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again
But hard to let them go
Do you hear it, babe
Do you hear it, babe
It was another time
It was another place
Do you remember it, babe
And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean
If you know what I mean
If you know what I mean
If you know what I mean
If you know what I mean babe"
Mr. Bojangles,"I knew a man,
Bojangles and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high, jumped so high
Then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans,
He was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg and stepped
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said his name,
Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
And jumped so high, clicked his heels
He let go a laugh Let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
He danced for those in minstrel shows
And county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years
How his dog and he traveled about
His dog up and died he up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time
I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask, please
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Go on and dance"
Red Red Wine,"Red, red wine goes to my head
Makes me forget that I still need her so
Red, red wine, it's up to you
All I can do I've done
Memories won't go, memories won't go
I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you leave my head

Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone

Both Sides Now,"Rolls and flows of angel hair
Ice cream castles in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain, they snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds' illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
Leave 'em laughin' when you go
But if you care, don't let em' know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads and say I've changed
But something's lost when somethings gained
Living everyday
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"
You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural (used to be)
Talk about forever
But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away
And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
And I learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
(So you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye)
You don't bring me flowers anymore
Well, you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
Well, you don't say you need me
And you don't sing me love songs
You don't bring me flowers anymore"
Brooklyn Roads,"If I close my eyes
I can almost hear my mother
Callin', ""Neil, go find your brother
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper
Hurry on""
And I see two boys
Racin' up two flights of staircase
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace
And his whiskers warm on their face
Where's it gone
Oh, where's it gone
Two floors above the butcher
First door on the right
Life filled to the brim
As I stood by my window
And I looked out of those
Brooklyn Roads
I can still recall
The smells of cookin' in the hallways
Rubbers drying in the doorways
And report cards I was always
Afraid to show
Mama'd come to school
And as I'd sit there softly crying
Teacher'd say, ""He's just not trying
He's got a good head if he'd apply it""
But you know yourself
It's always somewhere else
I built me a castle
With dragons and kings
And I'd ride off with them
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads
Thought of going back
But all I'd see are stranger's faces
And all the scars that love erases
But as my mind walks through thoses places
I'm wonderin'
What's come of them
Does some other young boy
Come home to my room
Does he dream what I did
As he stands by my window
And looks out on those
Brooklyn Roads
Brooklyn Roads"
Dry Your Eyes,"Dry your eyes, take your song out
When it's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, can you still recall the tune?
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, just like you're marching off to war
Sing it like you always wanted, like you sung it once before
And from the center of the circle, to the biggest of the waiting crowd
If it ever is forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud
And come dry your eyes
And you taught us more about living, than we ever cared to know
And we came to learn a secret, and we never let it go
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people see?
Right through the lightening and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon
To that distant falling angel, that descended much too soon
Come dry your eyes
Dry your eyes, take your song out
It's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune
And come dry your eyes
Come dry your eyes
Dry your eyes"

Morningside,"Morningside
The old man died
And no one cried
They simply turned away
And when he died
He left a table made of nails and pride
And with his hands he carved these words inside
""For my children""
Morning light
Morning bright
I spent the night
With dreams that make you weep
Morning time
Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine
For I recall the words the old man signed
""For my children""
And the legs were shaped with his hands
And the top made of oaken wood
And the children sat around this great table
Touched with their laughter
Ah, and that was good
Morningside
An old man died
And no one cried
He surely died alone
And truth is sad
For not a child would claim the gift he had
The words he carved became his epitath
""For my children"""

Let Me Take You In My Arms Again,"You'll be better off, I know
With another kind of man
All I've got is what I feel
And what I feel is what I am
But let me take you in my arms again
Let me take you in my arms and then
Let me see behind your smile
Let me love you like a child
Let me take you in my arms
I'm like a train that's rollin' on a track
Like a train that's got no turnin' back
Let me keep you from the storm
Let me make you safe and warm
Let me take you in my arms
You'll be better off, I know
With another kind of man
All I've got is what I feel
But what I feel is what I am
Let me take you in my arms again
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend
Like a ship without a sail
On a sea without a trail
Let me take you in my arms
You'll be better off, I know
With another kind of man
All I've got is what I feel
But what I feel is what I am
Let me take you in my arms again
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend
Like a ship without a sail
On a sea without a trail
Let me take you in my arms
But let me take you in my arms again
Let me take you in my arms and then
Let me see behind your smile
Let me love you like a child
Let me take you in my arms
Let me take you in my arms again
Let me take you in my arms and then
Let me see behind your smile
Let me love you like a child
Let me take you in my arms
Let me take you in my arms again"

If You Go Away,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away
But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away
If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
For the good's gone from goodbye
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away"
