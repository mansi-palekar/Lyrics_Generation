Bones,"Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Playing with a stick of dynamite
There was never gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)
Feeling like a boulder hurtling
Seeing all the vultures circling
Burning in the flames I'm working in
Turning in a bed that's darkening
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Look in the mirror of my mind
Turning the pages of my life
Walking the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in
There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind
There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind (there it goes)
There goes my mind
'Cause there's magic in my bones"
Believer,"First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer"
Enemy (with JID) - from the series Arcane League of Legends,"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint"
Demons,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide"
Natural,"Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural"
Thunder,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes sir"", not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic"", they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (never give up, never give up)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder (never give up, never give up)
Thunder, feel the thunder (never give up, never give up)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder (never give up)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder"
Lonely,"Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Some nights, I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes, I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and a day in a life
Mixing it up, checkin' it twice
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life
Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, ""Oh, love"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""Have mercy"" (I can get a little lonely)
""On me"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""And keep me company"" (I can get a little lonely)
I said-
Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh
Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, ""Oh, love"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""Have mercy"" (I can get a little lonely)
""On me"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""And keep me company"" (I can get a little lonely)
I said, ""Oh, love"" (keep me company, I said, ""Help keep me company"", I said)
""Have mercy"" (""Help keep me company"", I said, ""Oh, love"")
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me?
(Keep me company, I said, ""Help keep me company"", I said)
Can you keep me company? (""Help keep me company"", I said, ""Help-"")
L-O-N-E-L-Why am I so lonely?
Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said, ""Oh, love"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""Have mercy"" (I can get a little lonely)
""On me"" (sometimes, I can get a little)
""And keep me company"" (I can get a little lonely)
I said, ""Oh, l-"""
Radioactive,"Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive"
Bad Liar,"Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on
Innocent victims
Trust me, darling, trust me darling
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and
Crocodile tears
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go (go)
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin'
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Problems, problems, problems
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
Oh
Please believe me
Please believe me"
Whatever It Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"
Wrecked,"Days pass by and my eyes stay dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
Way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
Remember the words that you said
Remember the life you led
You'd say, ""Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinkin' of things that you should have done""
I'll see you again, my loved one
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here (loved one)
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone (I'm a wreck since you've been gone)
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along (I'm a wreck)
Yeah, I'm a wreck
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away but I can't
One more rainy day without you (one more rainy day)
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day but I can't
One more rainy day"
On Top Of The World,"If you love somebody
Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you move it
Now take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something
Now take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey

Warriors,"As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
Will come
When you will have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be the labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust"
Follow You,"You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I want to put you into the spotlight
If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you
Call you up, you've been cryin', cryin' all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight
If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da
Wherever life takes you, you know I'll follow you
You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here, comin' through)
I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you

Symphony,"Ever since I's young (coming up, coming up)
Always marching to a drum (bra da dum, bra da dum)
Always focused on me (one one, one one)
Now I wish that I could hold someone (someone)
So tell my mom I love her, call my baby sister
Should've hug and kissed her
'Cause life is just a mystery
And it's gone before you know it
So if you love me, won't you show it? Oh
'Cause this life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to me
I'm the chords and you're the melody
This life's one big symphony
She was the piano, I'm the xylophone
You can have the trumpet, I'm the saxophone
Life a skipping rope (keep going, keep going)
Finding solace in a note (dote dote, dote dote)
Had to struggle when I's broke (so low, so low)
Writing music just to cope (no hope, no hope)
Yeah, life is just perspective
Laughing when you've wrecked it
Smiling when you kept it together
You weathered the storm
At the end of the play, you sang all the way
Doesn't matter how off-key
If you did it your way
This life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to me
I'm the chords and you're the melody
This life's one big symphony
Would you care if I played you the flute?
See, it's my favorite one because it's so delicate and beautiful
I pull out the trombone if it's more suitable
Wanna make you smile
It's been a little while since I've seen the white of your teeth
Been a hard year
Lucky the guitar's here
Life is just one big symphony
'Cause this life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to me
I'm the chords and you're the melody
This life's one big symphony"
Birds,"Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die
I know that, ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die
I know that, ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again
Ooh, birds fly in different direction
Ooh, so fly high, so fly high
When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me
I know that, ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again
Ooh, birds fly in different directions

"Sucker for Pain (with Wiz Khalifa, Imagine Dragons, Logic & Ty Dolla $ign feat. X Ambassadors)","I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulder
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rolling with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been busting, no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain
I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear sh! t but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fvcking complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fvck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain
More pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain"
Shots - Broiler Remix,"I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you, and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't have you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (let me make it up to you)
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away"
I Don't Like Myself,"One day, I'll change my ways
'Til then I'm stuck in this space
Shut down and hiding my face
Tuned out and losing my faith
Stand up, tired of being a victim
You only on the outs if you with 'em
Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
Give 'em reasons (uh)
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination
There are times when I don't like myself
I believe all the things that they say about me
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself
This life is beating me down
But karma is coming around
Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me
A nightmare that's filling my dreams
Stand up, tired of being a victim
You only on the outs if you with 'em
Only hurts if you give 'em credence (uh)
Give 'em reasons (uh)
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination
There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself
I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I'll walk through fire for this
I will be the one to turn this car around
'Cause it's headed for disaster
No happily ever after
And I've got so much more to live for
Than what you think of me
There are times when I don't like myself (there are times)
I believe all the things that they say about me (about me)
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself
I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I, da-da, da-da, I don't like myself
I, da-da, da-da-da, I don't (I, da) li-li-li-li-like myself

It's Time,"So, this is what you meant when you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top, don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now, don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?
So, this is where you fell, and I am left to sell?
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top, don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now, don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now, don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now, don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?"

A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore

And I know I was born to be yours

My Life,"Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons
I'm tryin' to be somebody else
I'm findin' it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do
I'm runnin' out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm runnin' out of time
Is this really my life? My life
I could run from it all but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself, a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future
I'm tryin' to be somebody else
I'm findin' it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do
I'm runnin' out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm runnin' out of time
Is this really my life? My life
These years pass by and we're growin' older
And I think of you, all we've made it through
Some have passed away, some have moved on
But I'm still here today (I'm here today)
These years pass by and I'm growin' older
And I think of you, and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life?
And I think of you
I'm runnin' out of my mind
Is this really my life?

Is this really my life? My life"

Higher Ground,"I know when my day will come
Go back to the place that I came from
Looking back, will I think that I did the right?
I still don't sleep at night
I got these symphonies
Stuck in my head and they don't leave
Filling up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go
Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride
This life is such a ride, I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life, I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher ground
I've got that golden gun
I was born as the seventh son
Everything comes with conditions
Everyone's got their dirty dishes
I've got these memories
Stuck in my head and they won't leave
Filling up my treetops with these crows
I wish that they would go
This life is such a ride, I live until I die
I walk into the fire

What a life, I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try

Get it, got it, want it
Tell me what to do and I'm on it

Rise Up,"I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
(Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
(Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)

So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)

Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)

Machine,"All my life I've been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life I've been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
I am the machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale

Heart Upon My Sleeve (feat. Imagine Dragons),"With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, woah
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down
Now, I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you
Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together
(Together, together, together)
(Forever, forever, forever)
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down"
Monster,"Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made it's home inside (oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger"
Bad Liar – Stripped,"Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on
Innocent victims
Trust me, darling, trust me darling
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and
Crocodile tears
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go (go)
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin'
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Problems, problems, problems
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
Oh
Please believe me
Please believe me"

Bleeding Out,"I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
When the day has come
That I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating
Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow
You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
I'm bleeding out for you, for you
I'm bleeding out for you
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you"
I Bet My Life,"I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my"
Thunder / Young Dumb & Broke (with Khalid) - Medley,"So you're still thinking of me, just like I know you should
I cannot give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment, I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yessir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder
We have so much in common, we argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I'm right
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds
While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Oh, yeah
Nah, yeah
Oh, no, oh, yeah
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Young, dumb

Bubble - Night Visions Demo,"Yeah, we were young and we're so impressed
Yeah, I had that girl with the diamond dress
It's only things that I couldn't believe
And now you took it all away from me
You said, ""Call on me when you're in trouble""
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
Call on me when you're in trouble
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy
We don't want your sympathy
You had the money and you had the moves
And I had nothing 'cause I'm born to lose
So are you happy now?
You made a fool of me
You said, ""Call on me when you're in trouble""
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
Call on me when you're in trouble
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy
We don't want your sympathy
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy
We don't want your sympathy
But, you're the clever one
Got me falling for your fun
Got me falling for your fun
But, you crawl inside your hole
And count those corners on your stone
That would make you feel human again
You said, ""Call on me when you're in trouble""
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
Call on me when you're in trouble
I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy
We don't want your sympathy
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy
We don't want your sympathy
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy (I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble)
We don't want your sympathy
We're just wandering, we don't need anything (call on me when you're in trouble)
We don't want your sympathy (I got this feeling that I'm living in a bubble)
We don't want your sympathy"
Battle Cry,"Just one more time before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid, wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I've been poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save me now
King is crowned, it's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now, it's do or die
Nobody can save me now
King is crowned, it's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now, it's do or die
Just one more time before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid, wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now"
