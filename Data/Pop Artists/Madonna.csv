Song Name,Lyrics
La Isla Bonita,"Como puede ser verdad
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama"
Frozen,"Mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, if I could melt your heart
Okay, what's the addy?
All the lights are flashing
I'm surprised I barely made it, took two shots, I barely taste it
Red cups, I keep passing
Rolling peaks and valleys
Better focus, concentrating, took too much, I'm levitatin'
Open up the gates, I feel close enough to heaven
To go, to stay, to leave, to pray
C-cast out in the rain, guess they didn't like my confession
It's no mistake, I know it's just a bad religion
Whoa, whoa
Don't blow my high, don't calm me down
Don't text me back, don't call me now
Whoa, whoa
It's something in the water, yeah, I just came by to wash it down
Mmm (down, down), if I could melt your heart
Mmm (right, right, right, right), if I could melt your heart
Open up the gates, I feel close enough to heaven
To go, to stay, to leave, to pray
C-cast out in the rain, guess they didn't like my confession
It's no mistake, I know it's just a bad religion
Mmm (whoa, whoa)
Don't blow my high, don't calm me down
Don't text me back, don't call me now
Mmm (whoa, whoa)
It's something in the water, yeah, I just came by to wash it down
Mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, we'd never be apart"
Material Girl,"Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day
'Cause we're living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
A material, a material, a material, a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material"
Like a Virgin,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new (Hoo)
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine
Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa
You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine
Like a virgin, oh oh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me
Oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh"
Hung Up,"Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you

You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do

Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you"
Papa Don't Preach,"Papa I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please
Papa don't preach I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, hm
I'm gonna keep my baby, hm
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I oughta live it up
What I need right now is some good advice, please
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, hm
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh ooh
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love (in love), so please (so)
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, hm
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh ooh
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach (Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby)
Papa don't preach (Ooh)
Papa don't preach (Don't stop loving me daddy)
Papa don't preach (I know I'm keeping my baby)"
Like a Prayer,"Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer
Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there"

The Power of Good-Bye,"Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do ya wanna go higher?
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Learn to say goodbye
I yearn to say goodbye
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of goodbye"
True Blue,"Hey
What
Listen
I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before

Live to Tell,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me"
Crazy for You,"Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby"
American Pie,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
And can music save your mortal soul?
And can it teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing
Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this will be the day that I die
This will be the day that I die
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (the children screamed)
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed (the poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing
Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this will be the day that I die
This will be the day that I die
Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this will be the day that I die
This will be the day that I die
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing"
Take a Bow,"Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here (There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (No one around)
Watching you, watching me,
One lonely star (One lonely star you don't know who you are)
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile,
All the world loves a clown (Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (Role that you played)
No more masquerade,
You're one lonely star (One lonely star and you don't know who you are)
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart
I've always been in love with you (I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)

Jump,"There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste
I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
All work and no fighting, I'll find a place of my own
Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hands
Get ready to jump
We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
And life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see
Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait, the more time that you waste
All work and no fighting, I'll find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own
I can make alone
I can make alone
I can make alone
Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hands
Get ready to jump
Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?"

Ray of Light,"Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of Heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home

And I feel like I just got home

Quicker than a ray of light

Don't Cry for Me Argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

Don't ask them why because life is short
And before you know you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past

Well then there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

It's an illusion, I don't care
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion, come on over here
Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too
Can we get together?
I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you feel the same way too
It's all an illusion
There's too much confusion
I'll make you feel better
If it's bitter at the start
Then it's sweeter in the end"
Girl Gone Wild,"Oh my God
I am heartly sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven and the pain of hell
But most of all, because I love Thee
And I want so badly too be good...
It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body, feel the heat
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing
Hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray, my inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song, turn me on
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing
Hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me
Hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild"

Nothing Really Matters,"When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you (Everything I give you)
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need"

Ghosttown,"Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I know you're scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I'll never leave your side
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghosttown
When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghosttown
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I know you're scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, ahhhhh
I'll never leave your side
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around

Even with no light
We're gonna shine like gold
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghosttown
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghosttown
When the world gets cold

Drowned World / Substitute for Love,"I traded fame for love without a second thought
It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for, wanted it so badly
Running, rushing, back for more, I suffered fools so gladly
And now I find, I've changed my mind
The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who've settled for the thrill
Basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy
The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Famous faces, far off places, trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger, drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal, no laughter in the dark
No one-night-stand, no far off land, no fire that I can spark
The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
And now I find
I've changed my mind
This is my religion"
Angel,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near
You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why
You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes
You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel
Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes
You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby
Clouds just disappear"

Miles Away,"I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe those things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away
All my dreams they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
When no one's around then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart,
When we're six thousand miles apart
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone you realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles a-a-away
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

Pray for Spanish Eyes,"I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?
You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes
Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?"
Love Profusion,"There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine
There are too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love direction
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine, you make me feel
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration
And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine, you make me feel
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

Only you make me feel good"
