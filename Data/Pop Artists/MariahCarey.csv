Without You,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No, no, no, no, I can't live
(No, can't live)
If living is without you (no, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live (no, can't live)
(No, I can't live)"

Big Energy (feat. DJ Khaled) - Remix,"Got that real big energy
Hey daddy
When you gon' stop playing?
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Tell me how you want it
Three, two, one and I'm on it
Feel good, don't it?
Hood bitch, fuck you in a bonnet
I'ma bust it on the pole like Onyx
I'm just being honest
Pussy juicy, Minute Maid
But can't do it one minute, man
Not a side or a main, I'm the only bitch he entertain
Spending his, mine in the bank (in the bank)
I like what I see
A boss like you need a boss like me
Daddy from the streets, so he move low-key
Tryna rock that mic' like karaoke
On the count of three, bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we 'on't want it (we 'on't want it)
I'm the one you bitches hate, but they can't get past
Pretty face, no waist, and a big ol' ass, ha
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy)
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy)
Yeah, tell me how you want it
Three, two, one, camera rolling
Do it slow motion
Real bitch, them other hoes phoney
All that big talk, Latto put 'em on it
I'm just being honest, lingerie Dolce
Blindfold, tie me to the bed while we role-play
Can't skip foreplay, kill the pussy, cold case
I'm a boss bitch, but tonight, we do it your way
On the count of three, bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we 'on't want it (hell nah)
If you ever see me broke, I'm prolly rocking a cast
Pretty face, no waist, with a big ol' bag, ha
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy, yuh)
Got that real big energy
Got that big big energy (big big energy, ayy)"
Endless Love (with Mariah Carey),"My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath I take
You're every step I make
And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You'll always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And I
I'd play the fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(No, you know I don't mind)
And yes
You mean the world to me
I know I've found in you
My endless love
And love
I'd play the fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)
Oh, yes
You'd be the only one
'Cause no, I can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love (my love, my love)"
Hero,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you"
Fantasy,"Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby"
My All,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
(I'd) give my all for your love
Tonight"

Touch My Body,"MC, uh uh uh
In the place to be (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I know that you been waitin' for it, I'm waitin' too
In my imagination I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same my temperature's through the roof
If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in a Caribbean sea
If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
I'ma treat you like a teddy bear, you won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury, laying intertwined with me
You won't want for nothing boy (no)
I will give you plenty of joy
Touch my body, put me on the floor (put me on the floor)
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves (I know you like it)
C'mon and give me what I deserve (Give me what I just said that)
And touch my body

Ooh, ooh ooh

C'mon and give me what I deserve"

Obsessed,"All up in the blogs
Saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A
You so so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you've beem popping hood
You get it popping
Oh, why you so obsessed with me (boy, I wanna know)
Lying that you're sexing me (when everybody knows)
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing yo', you're confused you know
Why you're wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

So, oh, oh, oh, oh (and all my ladies says)
So, oh, oh, oh, oh

You on your job
You hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you

Gasping for air

You out of breath
Hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were
So why you trippin'?
You a mom and pop
I'm a corporation

Oh, why you so obsessed with me (and boy I wanna know)
Lying that you're sexing me (when everybody knows)

I Know What You Want (feat. Flipmode Squad),"Yeah
Shawty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out neither
I'ma give it all to you baby
It's burnin' on, bust it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short, how much longer can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now
Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it?
We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the God feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it

Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
(Listen) I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to 50 cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (Oh yeah)
Word is bond, never screw none of these industry cats (Boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Yes you know I'll die for you
And you know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you
I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back ma, I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it"

Heartbreaker (feat. Jay-Z),Unavailable
Angels Cry Remix - Remix,"I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you'd say
We could've made everything okay, but we just
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all, remember we
Used to touch the sky
And lighting don't strike
The same place twice, when you and I
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift,
But we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear
In a whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow
I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine
'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice
When you and i, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (don't let our love)
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you (baby I'm missin' you)
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (you can)
We gotta ride it through, (we gotta ride it)
I'm reaching for you (and I'm gonna say)
Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice
You and i, said goodbye, felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Oh babe don't let the angels cry"
Emotions,"You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions, yes you do
You've got me feeling emotions, yeah
You've got me feeling higher"
Bye Bye,"This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't never say bye (no, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we won't never say bye
As a child, there were the times
I didn't get it, but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes on Sunday mornings
And I missed you, but I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things' separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say if you were with me today, face to face
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on, I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you've gone too soon and the hardest thing to do is say bye
Bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on, I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you've gone too soon and the hardest thing to do is say bye
Bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (hardest thing to say bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (bye)
Bye bye (bye bye)
This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't never say bye (no, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
'Cause we won't never say bye bye
Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
Every day life goes on, I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached the better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
And the hardest thing to do is say bye bye (bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
So come on, somebody sing it with me
Wave your hands up high, hey (bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
'Cause this is for my people who just lost somebody (bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye) So this is for everybody
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye) Just kept your head to the sky
(Bye, bye) We won't never say bye bye"
Thank God I Found You (feat. Joe & 98°),"I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life
Thank God I found you (Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you (I was lost)
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
I will give you everything (Everything)
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do (Oh no)
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try (I don't wanna try)
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
Thank God I found you (I'm thanking you)
I was lost without you (So lost without you)

Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (Brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life (Completed)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude (Overwhelmed with gratitude)
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
See I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back (Looking back)
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way (This way)
Oh, thank God I found you (Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you (Lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream (And every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight (Brought the light)

Vision of Love,"Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind (yeah)
Sweet destiny (and you know that you did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me (prayed through the night)
Prayed through the nights (so faithfully)
So faithfully (faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually (he would find me)
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be, yeah, mmm"
Against All Odds (Take A Look at Me Now) - Mariah Only,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now
See there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've gotta take
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now

Through The Rain,"When you get caught in the rain
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain
Without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
As shadows grow close
Don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I'll make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh yes, you can
You're gonna make it through the rain"

Love Takes Time,"I had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone (Ooh-ooh)
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly (Oh-oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here, alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside (Oh, oh)
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much

The Roof (When I Feel the Need) (feat. Brandy),"Oh yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah
It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely
A little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words I love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
Pretty baby, how I'm missing you
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
Every time I feel the need

Butterfly,"When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly, butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly

So flutter through the sky

My Love,Unavailable
Underneath the Stars,"One summer night, we ran away for a while
Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Weak in the knees wrapped in the warm, gentle breeze
I, so shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high
As we drifted to another place and time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars, (oh, woah)
Young love
Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me and
I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And we left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting, drifting, drifting,
Drifting (and we drifted to another state of mind)
(And imagined I was yours and you were mine)
(As we lay upon the grass there in the dark)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Young love
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)"
Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme),"They can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter doing what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
They, they can do anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
Say
I, I have learned there's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul
That they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid
And the darkness will fade
'Cause there's, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
No
They can't take this
Precious love
I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go
They can say anything they want to say
Try to break me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily
Sailing out of their reach
Oh Lord
They do try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter doing what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes, they can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me"

Lead the Way,"Who would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together
And who could've foreseen
In you I'd find the place
I belonged forever
And if I move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
And I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure
And now
Nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you
And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
Suddenly you are lying here with me
And the truths I used to hold have changed
And if I move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way
If we move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way"
Someday,"You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only
But when your down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score"
When I Saw You,"Hmmm...
Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was a rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
Or as I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be a same
Na na na
Na na na
O-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-oh
O-only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changin' you with a tide and dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once, I knew
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be the same
With no beginning and without an end
You are the one for me and it's evident
And your eyes told me so, o-oh yeah
Your eyes let me know o-o-o-oh...
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be a same
O-o-o-o-oh...
I'd never be the same"

Can't Let Go,"There you are holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone, no no
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind
No I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let you go
Even though I try
I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go"
U Make Me Wanna,"Let's go
K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
A yo, the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for French curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team it's only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now, she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understands she's fine and understands she's mine
She understands the grind, cook, cleans and irons
And whatever she wanna push I'ma co-sign
And if I ain't got it already than I'ma go find it
I guess I'ma lucky don and she's a lucky queen
'Cause her jewelery box look likes lucky charms
All color stones and she know that I'm in the hood
But she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy thought I was in love with money
Till the first time we getting nasty
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh yo, whatever the road to paradise is, we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything
Even my rhymes
I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a women's point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a pearl long vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smells and the way she feel
And the sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so it's crazy ill
And we waitin' on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times, come on mommy, you whilin'
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh, when things was rough, only person I could call was you
Now everything I do, I do it all for you
Come touch me, come kiss me
Come love me anyway you wanna, boy
And I'm hood as long as I'm close to you
And we doing what grown folks is supposed to do, come on
Come hold me, come feel me
Come take me anyway you wanna, baby
Aye yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart it's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we've built
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn, I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it that's why ma, we gotta make it
K I S S me
Yeah uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Yeah uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
K I S S me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Yeah uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love
You make me feel love"
