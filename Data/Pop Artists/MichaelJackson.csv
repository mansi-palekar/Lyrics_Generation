Song Name,Lyrics
Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover"
Smooth Criminal - 2012 Remaster,"As he came into the window was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment, he left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table, he could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom, she was struck down
It was her doom

Thriller,"It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night, babe)
The foulest stench's in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
Are closing in to seal your doom (oh, yeah)
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try

So let me hold you tight and share a

Remember the Time,"I don't know, bet you wanna try

How it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long

Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times?
They'll just go on and on

When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?

Man in the Mirror - 2012 Remaster,"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
gonna feel real good now
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)
I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man
You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up
Stand up and lift

Gonna make that change come on

How did love slip away?

Stranger in Moscow,"I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby

Torture,"It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there
Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters
She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming?
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, strike a flame in me
Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
(It's heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
(Heading 'round the flame)
It's torture
(When you call my name)
It's torture, hey"

Thriller (Megamix),"It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking
In the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before
You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight
I'm gonna triller tonight
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination, girl
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight
I'm gonna thriller tonight
Killer, thriller
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thriller tonight
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
Killer thriller (Thriller tonight)
I'm gonna thriller tonight
I'm gonna thriller tonight
I'm gonna thriller tonight

Heal the World,"(Think about um, the generations
And ah, say we want to make it a better place for our children
And our children's children so that they, they
They, they know it's a better world for them
And think if they can make it a better place)
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place it was brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be god's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me, and the entire human race
There are people dying

Blame It on the Boogie,"Hee, hee, hee
My baby's always dancin'
And wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin'
And that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Woo
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't, on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

The Girl Is Mine (with Paul McCartney),"Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine

Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter

Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming

This Place Hotel (a.k.a. Heartbreak Hotel),"… Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
… As we walked into the room, there were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, ""Welcome to your doom""
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me
… We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
And said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon
… This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
… Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other (hee hee)
… Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's trial thought in beguile
To hurt me (this is scaring me)
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me
… We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through
… This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
… Someone's stabbin' my heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel

Ten years ago today

She told me she was all alone
Sad at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)

Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize

Never Can Say Goodbye - Single Version,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye, girl)

Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why (tell me why)
Is it so? (Is it so?)
That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye, girl)
Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why (tell me why)
Is it so? (Is it so?)
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl (never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh, ooh baby (don't wanna let you go, girl)

I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye, girl)
I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why (tell me why)
Is it so? (Is it so?)
Don't wanna let you go

The Love You Save,"Stop na na na, you'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It.
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit.
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing!
Stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone.
You'd better stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone.
I'm the one who loves you!
I'm the one you need!
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed!
They'll ruin your reputation!
They'll label you a flirt!
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh!
Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chimes.
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times!
Stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone.
You'd better stop, the love you save may be your own!
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Slow down.
S is for ""Save it""
T is for ""Take it slow""
O is for ""Oh, no!""
P is for ""Please, please, don't go!""

Stop it!

And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will i do?

And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night

'Cause i'm lying to myself

Is it my brother!

I can't take this stuff no more
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee

Would have mercy on me

That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth

'Cause the will has brought
No fortune

Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause i'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
It is a friend of mine

(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now

I can't take it 'cause i'm lonely
It is friend of mine

Don't you judge of my composure

And the reason why she left me
Did she find someone else?

A Place With No Name,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, ""Don't you worry my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""
Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin'
And smiling and nothing to fear
She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and started cryin'
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend
Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Oh, lord, yeah
Oh
She started likin' me, kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I seen the grass, and the sky, and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name

It's the Falling in Love,"It's the fallin' in love
That's making me high
It's the being in love that make me cry, cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
(Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause
No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
All night
And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying, ""Come and do me""
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
I'm fallin' in love
I'm fallin'"
Will You Be There,"Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show it to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
Hold me (show me)
Lay your head lowly (told me)
Softly then boldly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Lead me (hold me)
Love me and feed me (lead again)
Kiss me and free me (yeah)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human)
Carry (carry)
Carry me boldly (carry, yeah)
Lift me up slowly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Save me (lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me
I will be there (I will be there)
Lift me (told me, yeah)
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly (yeah)
Show me you care (will you be there?)
Hold me (woo)
Lay your head lowly (get lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly (I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there (will you be there?)
Need me (woo)
Love me and feed me (lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me (lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed (oh-yeah)"
Gone Too Soon,"Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon"
Ain't No Sunshine,"You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It is so good too
But it is just like my girl
When she is around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It is not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away"
Butterflies,"All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch you
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"

Ghosts,"There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around

Where a restless soul is going
I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw
Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy"
