Heartless,"In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could be so Dr. Evil?
You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3:00 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me (hey)
They say that they don't see what you see in me (hey)
You wait a couple months then you gon' see (hey)
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?"
Flashing Lights,"Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, light)
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
What do you know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights (lights, lights)
Flashing lights"
Ni**as In Paris,"We're gonna skate to one song and one song only
(Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me)
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me?
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
When I look at you like ""This shit gravy!""
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
Ball so hard, but since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable
To go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock
Rolex's that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
B-Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
B-Ball so hard, let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
B-Ball so hard, bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-towns, D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray
That shit cray
That shit cray
B-Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray
That shit cray
That shit cray
She said, ""Ye, can we get married at the mall?""
I said, ""Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball""
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray
That shit cray
Ain't it Jay?
B-Ball so hard
What she order?
What she order?
Fish fillet?
B-Ball so hard
Your whip so cold
Whip so cold
This old thing?
Ball so hard
Act like you'll never be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she 'on't wanna dance
'Scuse my French, but I'm in France
Hehe, I'm just sayin'
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would've-
Married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga?
What's Louis, my killa?
What's drugs, my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
'Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, heh?
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means
But it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
I got that hot bitch in my home
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The Stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know I got that feeling?
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
I'm definitely in my zone
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)
(Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone)"
I Wonder,"Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night (night, night)
(And I wonder) you say I think I'm never wrong (wrong, wrong)
(And I wonder) you know what, maybe you're right, aight?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
word
(And I wonder) do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is (and I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
and I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm (and I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house (if you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse (what it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (what it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (if you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (what it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean? (To find your dreams come true)
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams"
All Falls Down,"Oh, when it all (yeah)
It all falls down (this the real one, baby)
I'm tellin' you all (uh)
It all falls down (Chi-Town, stand up)
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (we gon' set this party off right)
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
Oh, when it all, it all falls down (uh)
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down
And when it falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
I say, ""Fuck the police, "" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all (yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down)
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
Oh, when it all (Chi-Town, Chi-Town)
It all falls down (We gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all (Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt)
It all falls down (you saved my life, c'mon)
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I's can't keep workin' like this
This grave shift is like a slave ship"
Gold Digger,"She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me (uh)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz?
Okay, get yo' kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid
You know why?
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head
18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than he is
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money (money)
If you ain't no punk holla, ""We want prenup""
""We want prenup!"", yeah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo' ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down, uh
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down, uh
Get down girl, go'n 'head
Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl
Get down girl, go'n head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n 'head get down
Get down girl, go'n head
Let me hear that back"
Homecoming,"I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!""
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again"
Moon,"I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
Hmm, hmm, here we go strappin', we up
Never forget all the memories
Sittin', I sip out my cup
Thinkin' I should be a better me
Truly I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, trouble in my soul
Hey, I've been prayin', life can be drainin', oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep haulin' on
I'm ashamed, hated what I will see
And nobody knows, so I go
How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (whoa)

How could I get through? (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
Ghost Town,"Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on Sunday
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Each one, knowing how 'm livin', smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna, some days
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray, it's not enough
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go (go), of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free"
Devil In A New Dress,"I love it though
I love it though, y'know?
Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us
May the God's be with us
And that magic hour
I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions
Oh she do it
What happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up
She casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wantedt, huh?""
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down its the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said, ""You are what you eat""
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phony
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes Sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps"
Stronger,"Work it, make it, do it
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger
N-n-now that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(Work it harder, make it better)
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
I need you right now
(More than ever, hour after hour, work)
I need you right now
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit

Follow God,"Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like type write
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my Dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like excite bike (stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three a piece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, I've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my dad (stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, he said ""That ain't Christ-like""
I said, ""Aah"""
Praise God,"That she wrote, ""Speech to the Young: Speech to the Progress Toward""
Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers
The self-soilers, the harmony-hushers

Look at new scenes, I opened my life, I'm subject to memes
I signed a few -, I polished their dreams
An angel on Earth, come under my wing
Stop running your publishers-
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y'all treat your Lord and Savior like renters' insurance
You know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom, I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows
I channeled them bad, all in abode
I challenge the trust, I challenge the turbulence
I came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let's get-
I just get right, huh
Let's get right, let's get right, let's get right, shh, shh
Ain't on sight, it's on sight

Ayy, all of my n-as on Channel 5
I don't channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my uncle's spaghetti
Been toting totes since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse out the day
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people serving no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Doing it for all the ones dying
I wanna do it for all the ones crying
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh"

POWER,"I'm living in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)
The system broken, and the school's closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'fucka, we rollin'
Huh? Ma'fucka, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the mornin'
Huh? I'll see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where y'all hiding?
I got the power make your life so exciting
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window
I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window
I'm letting everything go

Jumping out the window

No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?

And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without tellin' me

Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up five AM
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read ""No apologies""
The other said ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we prolly spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap, preach

Every bouncer every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us

Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale, I got five passports

Forever,"It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Drop the mix tape that shit sounded like an album
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me
Old money Benjamin Button. What? Nothing
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
Um, you're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and goddamn he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all

OK, hello it's the Martian
Space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top.""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh.
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing the name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth truth spilling
And spit true feelings,
Until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Pay back motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with
The bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me

'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go
Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul Van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, ""Dawg, in due time""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg, you where I am""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, 'cause this must be Heaven!
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like, ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die (yeah), you gon' touch the sky
We back at home, baby
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!
I'm, I'm sky high

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet

Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money

Everything we do is gon' come with a challenge
Every bitch you fuck is gon' come with a balance (what?)
Every shooter with me is coming in silence (what?)
And you niggas better pick a side (better pick a side)
You niggas side hoppin' (you niggas side hoppin')
If I want 'em to not let you come into the city, it's my option (baow)
This is the home of the fly shoppin' (yeah)
This where the bitches gon' watch pockets (yeah)
When I'm on TV, I gotta look good
'Cause I know the whole block watchin'
If you chill with the opps, we is not vibin'
If I see 'em in person, we Fox 5 'em
Yeah, the police is on us, we not stoppin'
(Yeah, the police is on us, we not stoppin', nah)
This is the town of the big drip (big drip), smooth talk (smooth talk, ha)
Milly Rock (Milly Rock), Shmoney Dance (Shmoney Dance), Woo Walk (Woo)
You will not survive being too soft (no)
Been a long time, we took a new loss (no)
Shooters shootin' 'til we got a new corpse (baow)
If we stop then we lettin' it cool off (baow, boom)
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me
We went off the grid (what?)
We ain't watch the throne, we took it
We went viral on 'em, they lookin'
It's a Sunday Service in Brooklyn (what?)
It's the city that come with the lights
I'm with the drillers that come with the night
They ain't do four years in college
But they'll do 25 to life
We make money every night (what?)
Never too big of a price (what?)
After I buy the Chicago Bulls (what?)
I'ma go link with Mike (what?)
And if I let 'em have my wife, niggas should thank me
With this Balenciaga and Balenci' boots and a new blue Yankee
This is Ye, I'm so focused, throw on a mask, no COVID
I'ma turn your life to a meme, let Justin LaBoy post it
You got an album? Postpone it
I drop two and they both going
I got a feeling they in they feelings
They filmin' a show, but won't show it
You gotta watch me in slow motion, I'm in that wide-body Benz
I go back to college, do an album, and then drop out again
Took me a minute to get here, my vision is crystal clear
Ayy, Fivi', excuse me, but this the feature of the year
I feel like Sinatra in these streets
Me and Drizzy, we at peace
This the backpack with the Polo and the first Jesus piece
I'm from the Chi' but I'm always New York
In the city, they treat me like Jesus is walkin'
I been through the pain and all of the torment
I'm sayin' His name, I make that important (what?)
Now it's time to give 'em hell
Ask my staff, I pay 'em well
This afternoon, a hundred goons pullin' up to SNL (what?)
When I pull up, it's dead on arrival
They act like they love you, they don't even like you
They throw a party, won't even invite you
I seen the same thing happen to Michael
You black and you rich, they saying you psycho (what?)
It's like a cycle
If you text me anything hype
You better text back and say it's a typo
The city of Gods, no city is like you
This the new New York, Ye is the GOAT
Fivi' is viral and this is the B.I.B.L.E (what?)
New York City, please go easy on me tonight (what the fuck? The fuck?)
(What the fuck?) New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me
Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy
Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy
Don't leave me, go easy, go easy, go easy
New York City, please go easy on me"
