Tusa,"¿Qué pasó contigo?
Dímelo, rrr
O-O-Ovy On The Drums (mmh)
Ya no tiene excusa (no)
Hoy salió con su amiga (ah), dizque pa matar la tusa (la tusa)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (ah)
Está dura y abusa (eh)
Se cansó de ser buena, ahora es ella quien los usa (oh-oh)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (mal)
Ya no se le ve sentimental (-tal)
Dice que por otro man no llora (llora), no
Pero si le ponen la canción (ah)
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando, lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (-zón)
Será porque con otra está (con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar
Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kicking and screaming, a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holler, holler
Ayy-yo, I used to lay low
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my JO (wuh)
Until I realized you a epic fail, yo
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place (uh-huh)
Getting some new D, sitting on a new face (okay)
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch you ever really met (ooh)
You searching for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (ooh)
Ayy-yo, tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and KAROL G, we let them rats talk
Don't run up on us 'cause they letting the macks off (rrr)
Pero si le ponen la canción (ah)
Le da una depresión tonta (tonta)
Llorando, lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (no)
Será porque con otra está (con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar, eh-uh
Un-un shot pa la pena profunda (eh)
Y seguimo' gastando la funda (la funda)
Otro shot pa la mente (yeah, yeah)
Pa que el recuerdo no la atormente (ah; oh)
Ya no le copia nada
Su ex ya no vale nada
Se va pa la disco y solo quiere perrear (perrear)
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar (tomar)
Ella se cura con rumba (ah)
Y el amor pa la tumba (eh)
To' los hombre' le zumban (le zumban)
Pero si le ponen la canción (oh)
Le da una depresión tonta (tonta)
Llorando, lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (oh)
Será porque con otra está (con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Ahh!
Bitch, I'm a monster no-good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye Wests sample, here's one for example
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know (I'm a motherfuckin' monster)
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best livin' or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
She came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial""
If you wanna make it number one, you're number two now
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyauh""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top off this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claimin' that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Lochness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still here fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder avenues, ah
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the Queen conquer
Okay, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rockin' gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young money is the roster and the monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
Fifty K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies gotta climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet, "" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Amb' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whip lash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (headed home)

Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat beef like sirloin

Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

Now you see me, nigga now you don't

Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
See, they told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum, I told her, ""Keep me clean, "" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
You know, one of the perils of makin' money
Is you can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj
And y'all still dyin, ' man, wassup? We in this bitch
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin'
Who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin'? Who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

Woman Like Me (feat. Nicki Minaj),"I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out
I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up
(Hey-hey-hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up
I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said girl, you're trouble and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me
And every time we touch, boy you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls, ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist, a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

You see a bad bitch coming through, yo, what's the hold up?
I'm in that new new, me and Nunu when I roll up
I told the valet, ""Park the Benz and bring the Rolls up""
Yo hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money
'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Banging body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me

See a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin', push, for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And whenever he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up I'm in a good foreign
I be like, ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like, ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
(Come on)

So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, ""Kiss kiss""
I'm in that new new De Larenta, tryna land Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me

Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag
I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
