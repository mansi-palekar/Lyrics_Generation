Feelin' Like Tunechi,"Turn your wife to a groupie (yeah)
He got smoked like a loosie (yeah)
Ride the wraith like a hoopty (yeah)
I been feelin' like, I been feelin' like Tunechi
Coming live from the 504

Got me feeling like, ""Yeah, fuck 'em""
Got me feelin' like Rich The Kid with grown-ass man money
I took the top off the 'cLaren, I'm letting the guts show
Walk in my bathroom, I step in the drug store
Treat the 200 for y'all like a tug boat, who want smoke?
Yeah, 'cause the bullet be drippin' like snot from a snub nose
I'm aimin' right to your heart like a love note
I told you right from the start, from the front door
I told her right from the pump, it's a gun show
It's me and Lil Richie and a fleet of some bitches
We stick to the code like Leo da Vinci
Many men, they wishing death upon me
Bop, bop, bop, give 'em three wishes
I need me a bitch that be needing them bitches
Fresh plate of pussy, I ain't cleaning the dishes
Chef's plate her bosom, yeah, I skeet on her titties
Creamy delicious, more babies than a pediatrician
Court days, I be leaning, I miss 'em
Nigga trippin' put the beef in the skillet
I pistol-whip 'em, I got teeth on the glizzy
Like, no way, can't believe it, I'm serious
No way, can't believe what I'm feelin'
No play, they don't need to play with me

Lonely (with Lil Wayne),"Caught up in my feelings, I'll fuck around and kill another nigga
You ain't even gotta push me, how I'm feelin' now
I been havin' mood swings like a Gemini
I can use the murder for therapy
I can make the news with it, break the internet
Have 'em all nervous and scared of me
Then get away sneaky clean, never seen a thing (K.I.D.)
I got .44 and F&N bullets and
Twenty-five thousand stuffed in these Amiri jeans
Damn, look at what happened to hip-hop
He at the GRAMMYs and still got that shit cocked
Pull out the camera with me and my bitch out
And take a picture
Ain't a hatin' nigga in the world fuckin' with big John
Knock his brains out if he got it on his mind
Lonely, lonely baby
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby (lonely, baby)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (k)
As if I got a reason to act like I'm lonely
I saw my big brother laid out with his brains out
It's been catchin' up to me
Shit, how would you act if your bro took his life?
And you know that you rappin' like all of these niggas
And you don't even trap and you livin' your life
The best you ever had just to see it come crashin', I'm burnin'
You don't know the feelin' in the car with
A bottle of liquor, a pistol, a lonely killer
Ain't no love at the top, just a lonely nigga
Ain't no love at the bottom either
All these blood-suckin' leachers and bottom feeders
All these sores on our feet 'cause we over-steppin'
He just caught his first one so you know he reppin'
He just a lonely, lonely baby, yeah, baby
Peter Piper picked the pepper
I pulled a stick out, hit him, then I left him
She pulled my dick out, hit her on the dresser
We fucked my aggression out
She like a pretzel how I fold her up and put it in her
She fuckin' a lonely nigga that's a killer, nigga
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby, K.I.D.)
Hmm, it's Weezy Baby, at the top, it's lonely
Got choppers on me, can't stop the moment
I just popped a soma and now I'm karma
All that body on me got you hot, I'm warmin'
And it ain't gon' help you more than I'm gon' harm you
Outchea by myself rollin' like a army
Fuck her by myself, fuck her with her homies
I'on need nobody, I'on see no solids
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bap, bet I'on see nobody
Come and see about it, I bet you see a rivalry
On Giovanni's and I bet this pipe knock the Peter out of him
Better pick the pepper, all the devils hide from here to Heaven
Better get her reverend, bet his momma cry when she hear the reverend
Shots hit the reverend, better get it extra with your lonely ass
On your OnlyFans, you a only fan
You gon' die a stripper, wasn't born to dance
Fucked a thousand niggas, I'm the only man let you stay lonely
Let you skate on it, let you play on it, then let you cuddle on 'em
Jay on 'em, like you are not alone
Lonely, lonely baby (baby)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (lonely, lonely, lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby (lonely, lonely, lonely)
Lonely, lonely baby
A lonely, lonely baby (you and I alone, k)
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Baby, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Baby, lonely, lonely, lonely"
Wockesha (with Lil Wayne & Ashanti) - Remix,"Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but uhm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup
What's in your cup, what's in their cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done
I probably should pick that cup back up (haha)
I'm seein' her lookin' like Keisha, like
""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (candy), sweet like fruit (ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I popped back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffe cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie, you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (that strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' my home (in my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with a heart to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (that somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm"
Hasta La Vista,"I tell you I love you
I tell you I need you
I say I won't leave you
(Uh)
I like when I'm faded, I'm so innovative
Eatin' pussy at my dinner table, I been gettin' it catered
Get the yayo, got me spendin' pesos, Benjamin tornado
Count my blessing's, this is what we pray for, everyone ain't able
Drop her heart, just like a hot potato, I'ma say though
She think she lit, I am fuego, keep that BS in her a-hole
'Cause I say so, and my bando, we just lay low
Rub my back, ask how my day go
I say I been on my J-O
She say, ""They know"", say no mo'
'Cause she go low, bless my wo-wo
I say ""Uh-oh, "" she start slow-mo
Once that coco start her mojo
She gon' go-go, she gon' deep throat 'til it's sore throat
She go deep sleep, I go NoDoz
Said ""I love you, "" watch my nose grow
Once that dope go, she go bozo
Girl, I'm gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby (yuh)
I tell you I love you, baby

I like when I'm faded (gone)
So outta here, keep that shit over there
Where do we go from here
Come to the end of the road
Can't get the road repaired
I am on Mars with a bitch in her underwear
She take 'em off and then come back to Earth
In a hundred years, you niggas gummy bears
Rest in peace Rabbit
I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears (ah)
Bitch, better not jump in here
Bitch, better not run in here talkin' crazy
Get her walkin' papers
See these married niggas makin' it hard for players
But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play
I give her dick and a couple ultimatums
A cup of bumbu and a cup of coffee later
She do all the drugs, he do all the favors
So we fuck now and we argue later
Dick runnin' like an alternator
I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em
I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors
You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later
So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down
On the morning paper, set it on the table
Told her, ""I'll be back"", Schwarzenegger
Li'l mama, I'm gone (gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (yah)
Hasta la vista, baby (hasta la vista)
Hasta la vista, baby (yah)
I tell you I love you, baby (I tell you I love you)

Then I get amnesia (gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (gone)

I tell you I love you (I tell you I love you)

Then I get amnesia (then I get amnesia)"
In This House (feat. Gucci Mane),"Actin' like they killers, but them niggas just some hoes
We act like this a studio, this really just a trap
Everything we got, we had to whip it out the bowl
Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (racks)
Twenty K for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store
She think she trickin' me, but bitch don't know my pockets swole (the money)
Big bankroll, top floor South Beach (top)
Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (ask)
Penthouse suite, four hoes, two weeks (yeah)
And all my shooters shootin' .223's 'bout me, Wop
Pick 'em with the AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga
You a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a ho and she a hoe, now that's too many hoes
Boy you been a hoe since Arsenio
Fuck yo' bitch, put her in the figure four
Scope on the gun, better visual
Silencer make the bullets tippy-toe
I don't give a fuck, never gave fucks
Always knew that a better day'd come
Haven't been asleep, seven day run
Never knew how a Chevrolet run
Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Ren, and Dre
I am the new NWA
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Take lives like students took lessons
Jail time, felt like it took seconds
I'm a Goodfella, was a dope seller
All these hoe niggas must be Hoe-chella
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
You a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga
Nigga with a AK-47

Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga
No bullshit, my nigga, I'm pushin' my triggers
They lookin' for niggas in bushes, my nigga
In the ocean, in the lake, in the woods, in the rivers
They skies was gray and the bullets was silver
Young Money on friend and my lady, my nigga
You front on your money, you quittin', my nigga
We kill you by breakfast and cook you for dinner
The lesbians say you a pussy-ass nigga, ol' hoe-ass nigga
I put some pressure on your hoe
Make her tell me what she know
Stop confessin' to that hoe
Stop confidin' in that hoe
Stop providin' for that hoe
You gon' die for that hoe
Suicide for that hoe
Boy, you been a hoe
I remember, hoe
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe

I Love You Dwayne,"Lil Wayne, Mama proud of you
You done came so far, I can't wait for your album to come out
A lot of people ask me when it's coming out
They can't wait for your album to come out
I'm just proud of you
You's my rock
You's always been my rock
Mama love you
I love you
You take care of me and my son
Your little brother, we never wanted for nothing
I thank the Lord everyday for keeping us on this Earth
And he would help
I just pray things go well for you in life
But I thank the Lord, 'cause I knew you been through a lot
That I don't even know about
Mama love you
I love you Dwayne, with all my heart
You's my life
I live for you
You make sure if mama is taken care of
I don't care if you don't have it, you gon' make sure I get it anyway
Even though you don't have it to give
And my son does so much, ain't wanted for nothing
Anything somebody call you for, you gon', you gon' make sure he get it
Your children
A true man
Mama love you, I can't wait 'til your album come out
'Cause everybody asking about it and I know it's gonna be a beautiful album
Love you Dwayne"
Don't Cry (feat. XXXTENTACION),"Yeah
C5
Don't cry, don't go
Won't lie, I f- love you, whoa!
While you're staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and 'round
Just another n- that done lost his head
No, a f- king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind, even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sipped from the fountain of youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, ""Don't cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherf- afterlife
Rest in paradise
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I f- love you (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go
Don't go (oh no, oh why? Oh why? Oh why?
Won't lie, (don't cry, don't cry) I f- love you (don't cry, don't cry)
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or is it do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath to effort
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry, don't cry), I f- love you (triple extension on my motherf- afterlife)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry), I f- love you (don't cry)
Don't cry, stay tuned
I want a triple extension on my motherf- afterlife
Rest in paradise"
Uproar,"I see, thank you man, thank you
Y'all know his name
Ayo, Mack, let the beat drop
Ladies and gentlemen, C5 (oh), Wayne time (oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone
Let me see your shoulders work
I mean, I don't know what y'all came here to do, but uh
If you don't ain't a lighter, what the f- you smoking for
We hot (ha)
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow, get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine, get it rough h-
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a sh- show, put you front row
Talkin' sh-, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over b- and above h-
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the f- for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the f- yo?
Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask, for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go?
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow, get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow, get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
Get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro'
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, bro
Puff, puff, bro, I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
""Knock-knock, who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the f-, bro?
It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag, like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the f- bro?
Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow, get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the f- though?
Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow, get the f- though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo"
Dedicate,"If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
You tatted your face
Bugatti, new boo
You screamed ""Suu-Whoop""
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your ex
Tattoos, Suu-Whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new Class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view, but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you with to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man and see through the con man
And now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over to diagram and get to the job man
Watch for the spycam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No we did not land on Plymouth Rock

In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, ""Now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot""
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes, too

Dark Side Of The Moon (feat. Nicki Minaj),"As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon as she wears slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I'ma miss it
The sky is fallling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipses eclipsin'
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world baby we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And If you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Open up the curtains
Window watching, people killing, robbing
The sky is falling, falling down
It turn into news and this is the apocalypse
People living on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stopping this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room, of I and you
Tell me will I see you soon
Meet you on the moon?
Intergalactical love

Mona Lisa (feat. Kendrick Lamar),"Quieren llegarme, pero es que no tiene el swagger, ey
Quieren los trucos, pero es que a ninguno le sale, ey

Tu jevo me escucha, se moja y se friza, ey, ey
Hace rato que voy volado y ustedes esperando a que yo aterrice
Muchos dicen infravalorado, pero si no he despegado fue porque yo no quise
Ya no busquen corona porque la robé y de Bilabo soy el prince
Tengo la boca caliente y ya no me friza aunque traigan el freezer
Quieren volver a llevarse conmigo, pero les he bloqueado
Todas las mujeres que pincharon antes llamaron pa atrás y a toditas les he dado
Que no he confiado, lo dejan botado, el buzón de voz ni lo he contestado
Si quieres tirarme pues tira ma nigga, pero te aseguro que quedas noqueado
Porque de flow le falta un chingo
Tienen los códigos, yo tengo el PIN
Como Mickey Goodman, nigga andamos clean
No te mete en mi línea pa que no desvíe, yeah
Toditos están rezando pa que yo me quite
Pero mientras ellos miran desde los bleachers
Quieren llegarme, pero es que no tiene el swagger, ey

Sometimes I feel like I ain't s-
Sometimes a n- feel like s-
Talkin' 'bout some real life s-
Goodbye letter, dear life s-
So if a n- kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life s-
Goodbye letter, dear life s-
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live then I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to f- a young n- up""
Lord
A few b- left me
That only got a new b- elected
My old b- was too disrespectful
And only get my new b- respected
That's power, yes
It's now or next
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh s-
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh s-
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror
That n- weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?
Dear life
What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked b- really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm f- more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
Can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta n- think I got a lotta n-
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he said he got a n-
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The s- I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave, you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags on mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect s-?
Mama told me, f- the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these h- 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, n- better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm getting sober-headed
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
Dear life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader
Dear life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
You know, when he told me that Toya was havin' a baby, I say

Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
That's mind blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
You can't spell fame, without me

Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer, ""don't let me make these bitches famous""
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twistin' life up when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives, ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass and I heard, ""Can you look this way?
Can you look this way?""

Hittas,"Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently
She was crazy, stupid thick
Mack in here, Scoob here in here with me
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell 'em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around
Tell 'em bitches lap up
I'ma cut this music down
Tell 'em put they AP's up
Tell 'em throw they pride out
Roll them windows back up
Money in the air, who say white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
Ak-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around
Tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down
Then them hoes get passed up
Sittin' on this money to me feel like a cactus
I'm stickin' to this shit
You would've been have hopped yo' ass up

Crickets

You got niggas but they not hittas
They got jitters, they get hit up
I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae yo' niggas
Don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceut'
They armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle
We draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers
We gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper
We gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual
My hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you
Just like Bazookas, don't confuse 'em
We only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, whoadie

And I just said he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin'?
Which I used to pray, and ask the Lord to send me one
You know, he did

He's, he's done been here before"
Took His Time,"Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety

And look alive, look alive
Smoke one, ready to po' one
Tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy, 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happy his goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em
You can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest, soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on
Aw daddy, the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sam's card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head bad hair day
In broad day light let's play, lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs, though?
At your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum bum bum bum bum if they come for 'em, I tell 'em
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presence, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelming
Talking money over salmon in Italian and Australian
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azeleas
Sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, coming from what's coming at ya
I come from where they come at ya
In a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin' I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been black and I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus, got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know why I'm not answering you should kill who you been askin'
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

Mess,"Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
My bae is a mess
My side bi- a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bi- possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
To the left, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bi- that prefer to pleasure
It's quater-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess, my life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
More ones, my bae is a mess
My side bi- is a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bi- possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess
Yes, no pressure, it's a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'ma a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the sh- and now we talking
Now fast foward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, make-up, and lashes
Out of place mattress, sh- happens 'cause my days is a mess
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo

Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

Dope New Gospel (feat. Nivea),"Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me see like an eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes
Hasta la vida, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro so my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that it's a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
These tattoos, they can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror my 'migo
Creme de la, creme de la creole
Couple a cracks in the mirror, he been through the cracks
I see no cracks in me, though
Daytime, start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God, Wheezy back, order is restored, all is right with the world
Last times become we lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind, but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road, but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the mothafuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own

So I never really found out about what, you know
What really went w-, really happened with him and that shooting"
Let It All Work Out,"Let it all work out

Work out, yeah
I'm in this b-
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this b-
But now I'm in this b-
Yeah, I'm in this b-
Tunechi you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I'm loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But f- 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this b- and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that sh- that give a flower color
And some b- named Wonder Woman
Told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real sh-, n-, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though
Swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my n- with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on 'em
'Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these n- be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it's fair, n-
I'ma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a f- rocking chair, n-
Bad b- play with my hair, n-
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don't stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""
C-5
Yeah, back in this b-
Tune you left this b-
Like you knew this b-
Was gon' let your a- back in this b-
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this b-
Let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Cita you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me
I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real sh-, p- n- on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no p- n- shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out"" (yeah)
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror
But you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God, came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a profit
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out"" (phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, remember this)
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch)
""Let it all work out"" (yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(And don't forget what I did this, bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch)
""Let it all-""
""Let it all work out"" (yeah)
""Let it all work out""

Uh, all my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all

Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?

Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom

Do you ever get nervous?

Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square

Pop that pop that pop that (What ya twerkin' wit'?)"
She Will,"Young money, yeah, four
I tell her, ""Now goin' pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet, ha ha
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""Baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel

She will, she will, she will (she will, she will)
Yeah, I tell her ""Now go on, pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that wine and dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say chose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""Baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah, do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
