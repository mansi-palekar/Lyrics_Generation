I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that sh- a lot
Took her panties off and this b- thicker than a plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them h- busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your -, baby, can you -?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21)

I'm on that Slaughter Gang sh-, ayy, murder gang sh-
Ayy, Slaughter Gang sh-, ayy, murder gang sh-

Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Clickin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' n- seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad b- waitin' on a n- like I'm PnD
I'm steady pushing P, you n- pushing PTSD
I told her a- to kiss me in the club, f- a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like the DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers like askin' if I f-, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels, but she left out on her cozy sh-
Ayy, I'm livin every 24 like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P the 8
Swear this sh- is getting ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from 12, but I don't reciprocate
51 division stay patrolling when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eating off a Baccarat plate
See Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet, that's a rookie a- mistake, ayy

Major Distribution,"No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Major distribution, man, my label on my dick, for real
Fuckin' with your friend and she ain't tell you, y'all ain't shit, for real
I've been out here crushin' on success, now she my bitch, for real
You say I'm persuasive, girl, but you can't spell that shit, for real
Hmm, hmm, in this mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Paid in full, I'm Mekhi Phif'
Know you're tired, we just did dinner for three hours
Lyin' to me all night
Buyin' BM's Benzes out of spite
Paid a hundred, ran up somethin' light
Simple price to keep 'em out my life
Booby Trap, we need a business office
Magic City, need a business office
Twenty-nine, I keep a business office
I'm in love with Houston, Dallas, Austin
Tell your guys to hold off on the team chains
Seem like they may need money for coffins
Cuban girl, her family grind coffee
Text me on the signal, don't call me
Hmm, hmm, major distribution, labels call me
Bad Bunny numbers, it's a robbery
Five-hundred million, just for Aubrey
Mmm, hmm, yeah, major distribution how I pop it
Mention me to be the hottest topic
Same place you send your bitches shoppin'
Okay, go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Okay, okay, go stupid, stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, okay
Nigga tried to play this shit light, play it cool, play me like I'm sweet
Fuckin' on an opp nigga bitch, say she miss the golds in my teeth
4L shit, know we steppin', y'all should get to funeral preparin'
SF90, this is not McLaren, make an IG model run my errands
He go missin', we gon' spin his parents, stayed in Houston long as Steve Francis
Shoot his feet, got him doin' dances, wiggin' niggas like I played at Kansas
Ever seen somebody get shot? Lot of shit I seen before the top
I ain't tryna wrestle like The Rock, fuck the Tris, I'd rather sip the Wock'
Lot of things I do to stay alive, everything except for call a cop
Savage still let his gun pop, FOX 5 gang, get you knocked
Major distribution, labels callin', Harry Styles numbers, it's a robbery
My niggas go in-Zayn to catch a body, we was face to face, you could've shot me
Okay, go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Okay, okay, go stupid, stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, go stupid
Go stupid, okay"
STAYING ALIVE (feat. Drake & Lil Baby),"Try me a hunnid times

It's not like I known her for months
This life, it allowed me to take what I want
It's not like I know what I want
It's not like I know what I need
I get some time, but it's no guarantees
When I was broke, she was bein' a tease
Four pockets full, now she down on her knees
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Or I'ma hit it and send her to Baby
That's how I get when this life get too crazy
Whoa, whoa, for real, for real, whoa

Whenever I see you, you mine
Drizzy hit her and then he send her to me
I don't talk, definition of P
Hood nigga turned superstar
But I fuck her good like I'm still in the streets
No response, you can see that I read it
I'm with all that whenever you ready
Sure be happy if I fell off, but I'm still there
They gon' have to accept it
Try me a hunnid times (yeah)
Wanted me to lie, wanted me to cry, wanted me to die

Privileged Rappers,"Whoa, whoa, yeah

WAIT FOR U (feat. Drake & Tems),"Early in the morning, late at night (I will wait for you)
It don't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie already on the way (higher, sayin', ""Aye, yi, yi, yi"")
Whenever I find time, it's okay (ayy)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going
I been in the field like the children of the corn
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (world was ending)
Travel around the world (would you cry, or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (tell me now, I want you be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do drugs (tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Yeah, I been trapping 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feeling
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a living (will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feelings flowing like a river
You be texting back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say ""Delivered"" (I will wait for you), but I know that you 'on't get it
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fucking for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dawg, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barking over dinner
I was fucking with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you
I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone
Gossip, being messy, that ain't what we doing, yeah (world was ending)
Trapping around the world (would you cry, or would you try to get me?)

On BS,"Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa
I had to cut some niggas off, they didn't mean me no good
I come from the ghetto, so my trunk is in my hood
She wouldn't wear no panties 'round me even if she could
Gave out plenty spankings 'til they got it understood
Fuck the nosebleeds, baby, come sit on this wood
If you know it's tension, don't come 'round me like it's good
I got street smarts and you can't get this out no book
I can't right my wrongs, but I can still write these hooks
Oh, time to get exposed
You ain't been from 'round here, nigga, come get off your show
Savage said you pussy and he hit it on the nose
But that border's open, why you actin' like it's closed?
I don't know
Y'all be goin' in and out recessions
The same way that I be goin' in and out of Texas
Or in and out my sessions, or in and out her best friends
Or in and out these courtrooms, my lawyer like, ""Objection""
Yeah, whoa, whoa
All my bitches Spanish, Boricua
Water on my neck, these diamonds came with coral reefer
She from overseas, I had to buy her a new visa
Met your wife in Vegas, but I hit her in Ibiza
She a supermodel, so she only eatin' Caesar
Used to date a rapper, but he acted like a diva
Niggas hustlin' backwards, out here ballin' with the reup
Popped an Adderall, I feel like I can lift a tree up
Seen too many cameras, so I never lift my ski up (yeah)
I jump on your song and make you sound like you the feature
I jump on your song and make a label think they need ya, for real (yeah)
On that bullshit (okay), on that bullshit (okay)

All the bullshit
Damn, maybe I should do a twenty, maybe I should break that twenty, do a ten
Maybe I should break that ten, do a five, then if it gets live, do a five again
If he held his tongue on that live, he'd be alive again, damn
My uncle's sister know she raised a real one, ill one
It's been thirty minutes, I don't feel nothin'
Oh shit, wait a minute, think I'm startin' to feel somethin'
Where you get this motherfuckin' pill from?
Heard they got some sanctions on my name
Heard they plottin' on my name, heard they bankin' on my name
I got Lita in this bitch and he might spank it on a lane
I'm just- what? In the cut, throwin' Franklins on her frame
I'm a- ayy, I'm a gentleman, I'm generous

Nah, I'm on, it's midnight, I don't care
Nothing's happening on a Wednesday, I don't care, I'm on
I'm looking for the smoke
This guy sitting front row, man, poof, who needs that?
Let me put my window down, I need fresh air
We don't want that, we want bars
The reason why we listen to 21 and The Boy
That's what we do in Paris, we don't do Fashion Week
Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us
It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city
The lights of the Eiffel Tower
I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day
And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly
Whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12
I drive a four-cylinder, I come from nothing but I'm doing something
And you cannot catch my drive
As fast as you try to go, you will never catch me, man
There is only one way, and this way I'm driving, nobody can do it
I'm Birdman, that's who I am
In Paris
Brrt, brrt"
What’s Next,"Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah
I'm makin' a change today, the liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away, that's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you? I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death, but I told you the truth
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been, woah
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road? Okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up, and they say you sellin' your soul, okay
They want my life exposed
They wanna know about the highs and lows
Well, summer all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day I had sex, okay?

Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles

This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business

Know you got some brand-new life goals
Baby blue but you are not a baby, I know, shawty, I know
Yeah, so why you gotta be so hardheaded?
Why you wanna ask girl? You know what I did
Acting like you don't already know what that is
Baby just relax, I'm on your side
I will not discuss it with nobody
Neither of our pasts 'bout to go away
You made me forget about it anyway
I know, I know
Black boxes with the bow and rose
Lil' side hustle with the Fashion Nova

Mom and daddy didn't really get along, shawty

Spin Bout U,"You gotta motherfuckin' feel this shit, boy
(BanBwoi)
Woah
I got feelings for you
Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
How many bodies you got?
Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames
When you was young and in school
He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main page, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutique or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into
If you out in public, and he want your number, just tell him, ""My nigga'll spin you""
The way you make me feel these days
Somethin' gettin' dry for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days
Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
Comin' out my body for you
Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
Are makin' laws about what women can do
I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
So I gotta respect ya
Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is pressure
Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone

Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real
The way you make me feel these days
Somethin' gettin' dry for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days

Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count money all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up

Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time I gotta ask niggas what their profession is
Ushered a generation in these are where my confessions live

I did brunch with the judge, we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore

All my Rolls Royces got a different body (facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it

Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix

The ones that purchase the vehicles 'cause of trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never show me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty's heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mill's
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drank sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real but it's never real, yeah

Picture my signature on a pair of some J4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no, ""K, sure""
Soon as I tell you that you the one I will wait for
You too saucy, too flossy
You moved in then moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love gettin' T-d up, love showin' the cakes
You know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spellin' mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
(Them niggas just can't understand it)
I want you to change my mind, I'm prayin' you pullin' up
Know who you bein' 'round, I know that they teamin' up
Tellin' you you better off leavin' me in the dust

Love All (with JAY-Z),"Previously on Ready To Die
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P.
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm taking
Pouring out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta falling outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P.
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like ""pardon my reach""
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm taking
Long way down from the heights I'm chasing
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checking in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turning off my phone for the night now, baby
Pouring out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P.

Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Niggas wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
Nigga, y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
Best thing I can do is not build with you
When I could destroy you, that takes some fucking discipline
I could send a team to come drill you, I got a billion or two
And I know where the fuck you live
Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh
This ain't what you want, no
All that back and forth on the internet
Nigga, we don't tennis that
Y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
I'm public enemy
Niggas wanted to kill me, and y'all want me to be friendly
Niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
Be those closest to it, be the very ones that envy
Shout out to the family
I don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
Everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing
But everybody want something
You know the price of everything but the value of nothing

7am On Bridle Path,"Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need for me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the hoe ratio, I'm like David Caruso
There's a mad shortage of people givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say ""True though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the wrath of that Casper The Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
I switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got 60 of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Khaled cut 'em all before my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come through without blowin' eye lashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hunnid thousand on the line
At the table playin' banker, shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man fuck a ""Respectfully"", I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I can give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Get that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
Why you over there tryna impress the nation?
Minds runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin' doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin
Niggas textin' ""Bro"", but we are not in no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to the feet like we rollerbladin'
Far as the ""Drake era"", man we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three
Then you been slidin' the third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day ""Boy, you're going places""
Never understood where I could really take it
Yo"

Won't Be Late (feat. Drake),"Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (on me), this right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby, don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first, but now I'm not
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standin' in line for you (Standin' in line for you)
Standin' here for I don't know how long, girl

Money In The Grave (Drake ft. Rick Ross),"Yeah, okay
Lil' CC on the beat, mm
Yeah, yeah
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave ya
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave
Couple figures, killers call and collect (collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (next)

Roll with us if you really wanna get it (get it)
Go getter, half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (no limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yay
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (bounce)
Gotta count up my allowance (gotta count up my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (so I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (about it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (house)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (yeah, gang)
I'm mister body catcher, Slaughter Gang soul snatcher

Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'

Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies
Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies
I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her

Get Along Better,"Uh
This might be too real, too real
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, supposed to be mine
Baby
I need some help just like anyone else
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes
Baby
You said you felt something for me (talk to 'em)
I don't know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologized
When you came to see me and then (then what?)
You had the nerve to defend (defend what?)
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you crazy
Someone that's close to you reached out to me
Just to see if we had made amends (oh)
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend (woo)
And it's wrong, I know (know, know, know)
But again (ooh, yeah)
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend (oh)
And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh
No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something that's different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Don't you dare (don't you dare)
Don't say you're proud of me
Hurt's just unreal to me
Now you wanna come crack to me (crack, crack)
Three whole years after me
Why did you wait 'til the end?
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend, friend
And it don't feel wrong, but again
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend

Gold Roses (feat. Drake),"Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah
She got a thing for Chanel vintage
That dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20-20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
""I gotta get the most of everything""
Is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
(This different right here, yo)
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (stop talkin', stop talkin')
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face, won't you?

Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

One Dance,"Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist

The foreign is yellow, like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand new whip, got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu

Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo

Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, ""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle

Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop

When your river's overflowing, mmm
It's the truth, swear to you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
And all that you are, I do
My single line of stars in noon
Reflection of the very moon, I do
I do, I do, I do
Show my love for you
Can I show my love for you?
(Can I show my love for you?)"

That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Poetic Justice,"Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you
When you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and them?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really hope you play this
'Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem (ask him if he here for Sherane)
Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?
I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap I'm sorry
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay
Or where your daddy stay, okay? Fuck with all this talkin'
As a matter of fact, get out the van, homie
Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie"
Pipe Down,"Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
It's like home to me (she belongs to the streets)
It's like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now it's lookin' like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me
And when you see Chanel, I wish that's how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish that's how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And it's a lot of niggas' trust, I put the list together
And it's a lot just to assume we're meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you can't just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you should've been dead right now
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?
Tried to run it back a hundred times
The world is yours, but the city's mine
I can't believe you put it on your mother's life
I can't believe you told me it was ride or die
'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive
True enough I know you're from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
But you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?
Baby, pipe down
Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Omertà,"Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the twenties up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah"
All Me,"Got everything, I got everything

No help, that's all me
All me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
Ah, she want all the fame (Want all the fame)
I hear that shit all the time (All the time)
She said she love me
I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself
You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next
But I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat
I'ma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, Goddamn
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got

All me for real
Came up, that's all me

Hoe, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch"
Trophies,"Yeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anythin' I got is not a rental, I own that mothafucka
Figured out this shit, it's simple
My stock been goin' up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But, nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mothafuckers
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a ""fuck a stripper on a mink rug"" song
This a ""fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge"" song
""Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub"" song
Nigga, ""just because"" song
What's the move?
Can I tell truth? If I was doin' this for you
Then I have nothin' left to prove, nah
This for me, though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it 'cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
Bitch, I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, ""I heard all your niggas stay where you stay""
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mothafuckers
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a ""doin' me and only God can judge"" song
""I do not know what the fuck you thought it was"" song
""Pop some fuckin' champagne in the tub"" song
Nigga, ""just because"" song

Ignant Shit (feat. Lil Wayne),"Yeah, I appreciate
Your patience tonight
It's been a moment since
I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's,
You know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you
Just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion,
You know what it is
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here,
I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie,
No glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home,
No stop over
Still spittin' that shit
That they shot Pac over
The shit my mother
Look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas
I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over,
I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin',
I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein'
Me all hard
And lyin' to they girls
And drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their
Problems became ours
'Cause we have nothin' in
Common since I done became star
I done became bigger,
Swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used
To holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make
The drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that
I without fear claim
What I set seems to
Never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby,
Word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money,
See the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's
Waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six
In the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver
Could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads
To offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin'
Everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon'
Have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like
Lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie,
Call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger,
But I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table,
Nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday,
Boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG,
But I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me,
Nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money,
Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with,
I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year,
'06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out,
I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any
Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free
Weezy, go
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and
Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank
To make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt,
I stunt hard
And if the food ain't
On the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime
You can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the
Drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead,
Word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark,
Leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin',
I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign;
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your
Pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes,
Your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side,
I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments
For your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch

Young Money in your tummy

Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet,

Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money,
Headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven
If you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards,
'Bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches

Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check

That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna' get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold

Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say ""your lyrics do shit for me""

Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Last night I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things

I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that
